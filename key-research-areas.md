# Key Research Areas

OS Research focuses on five core problem areas that we believe are critical to Vietnam's future. These are the domains where we invest our energy, build startups, and validate ideas.

## 1. Education

Vietnam's young generation is growing up in a system that measures obedience more than creativity, rewards memorization over problem-solving, and leaves students unprepared to create real value in a rapidly changing world.

Without a modern educational approach that nurtures imagination, critical thinking, and the ability to build things that matter, Vietnam risks losing its opportunity to rise as a nation of innovators.

**What's needed:** A new model that empowers children and young adults to become capable, confident, and future-ready contributors to society.

## 2. Insurance

Most Vietnamese families remain financially vulnerable because insurance is fragmented, opaque, and inaccessible. People do not receive the protection they need—not due to lack of demand, but because the industry has failed to earn trust, simplify its products, and integrate into daily life.

Without modern, transparent, tech-enabled insurance infrastructure, millions of individuals and businesses face avoidable financial shock.

**What's needed:** Better insurance solutions that protect people, bring peace of mind, and enable long-term prosperity.

## 3. Urban

Vietnam's cities are growing fast, but the systems that support daily life—transportation, housing, public services, family care, and basic administration—remain slow, inefficient, and burdened with outdated processes. These "boring problems" quietly drain time, money, and energy from millions of people every single day.

If left unsolved, they will limit economic productivity and quality of life for an entire generation.

**What's needed:** Bold urban innovation to improve how people live, move, and manage their families in modern cities.

## 4. Health

The gap between how long Vietnamese people live and how well they live is widening. Rising stress, poor lifestyle habits, limited access to preventive care, and an aging population are putting immense pressure on families and the healthcare system.

Without a shift toward healthier living, early prevention, and long-term wellness, Vietnam will struggle to support a strong, high-performing workforce and dignified aging for its elders.

**What's needed:** New solutions that make well-being accessible, practical, and sustainable for every household.

## 5. Culture

After decades of rebuilding from war, Vietnam's cultural foundations remain underdeveloped. Many young people grow up with limited understanding of the traditions, values, and stories that shape our identity—leading to weak cultural confidence at home and an unclear cultural voice abroad.

As the country moves into a new era of growth, this gap prevents Vietnam from reaching its next level.

**What's needed:** Deliberate investment in reviving cultural literacy, nurturing creative expression, and strengthening national pride—so that Vietnamese people can stand taller in their own identity and share a more confident, authentic Vietnam with the world.
