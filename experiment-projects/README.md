# Experiment Projects

Projects that have validated a **real problem** with a **huge market potential** and are now testing solutions, business models, and go-to-market strategies.

---

## Entry Criteria

- ✅ Problem is validated (real pain, not assumed)
- ✅ Customer segment is clearly defined
- ✅ Market size is attractive (TAM/SAM/SOM calculated)
- ✅ Key assumptions identified and prioritized
- ✅ At least one desirability hypothesis validated

## Current Projects (Q1 2026 Focus)

| Project | Type | Problem | Stage |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| [25003-xanhsm-programmatic-taxi-ads](./25003-xanhsm-programmatic-taxi-ads/) | In-House Venture | No programmatic DOOH in Vietnam taxis | Solution Fit |
| [26009-bee-digital-v1](./26009-bee-digital-v1/) | Cash Engine | BeeVN needs digital insurance platform | Business Model |

## Experiment Phases

### Phase 1: Solution Fit
- Does our solution solve the validated problem?
- Will customers use it?

### Phase 2: Business Model
- Will customers pay?
- What's the right pricing model?
- What are unit economics?

### Phase 3: Go-to-Market
- What channels work?
- What's the CAC/LTV ratio?
- Can we acquire customers repeatably?

### Phase 4: Scale Readiness
- Can we deliver at scale?
- What breaks at 10x volume?

## Exit Criteria (to validated-projects/)

- ✅ Repeatable revenue (not one-off sales)
- ✅ Positive unit economics
- ✅ Clear path to profitability
- ✅ Ready to invest in growth
