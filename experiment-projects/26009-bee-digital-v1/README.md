## Overview

bee-digital is BeeVN's proprietary digital insurance platform with two core functions:

1. **Sell Insurance** - Distribute insurance products across all Vingroup touchpoints
2. **Manage Claim SLA** - Monitor and enforce insurer SLA compliance

### Partnership Structure

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **OS Research** | Technology partner - build & operate platform |
| **BeeVN-Digital** | Business partner - customers (Vin ecosystem), insurers (all 7 majors), investment |

## Project Evolution

```
Embedded Insurance (refuted) → Claims Processing (pivoted) → bee-digital (current)
```

The project began as "embedded insurance" for Vingroup apps. Through validation:
- Vingroup said "not the right time" for embedded insurance
- Customer interviews revealed collision market (garages + insurers) as real opportunity
- Final positioning: BeeVN's platform to sell insurance and enforce claim SLAs

## Key Findings

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Car owners are well-served | B2C = vitamins, not painkillers |
| Fraud detection NOT a priority | Don't lead with fraud |
| AI Call Center has explicit demand | Quick win for insurers |
| Garages = high pain, low politics | Best stakeholder to serve |
| VinFast won't co-develop | Target insurers first |
| BeeVN has no tech capability | Willing to invest heavily |
