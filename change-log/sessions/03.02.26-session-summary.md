## Technical Notes

### Existing Solutions Analyst Agent

The new agent follows a rigorous 4-step methodology:
1. **Problem Decomposition** — Maps Jobs/Pains/Gains before researching solutions
2. **Global Solution Mapping** — Analyzes category leaders, regional players, emerging disruptors
3. **Gap Analysis** — Identifies unsolved pains, underserved segments, non-customers
4. **Verdict & Recommendations** — Provides honest assessment with specific next steps

Output format includes:
- Structured tables for competitor comparison
- Blue Ocean Three Tiers of non-customers analysis
- Market assessment ratings (Red/Yellow/Green)
- Actionable VPC/BMC refinement suggestions

Agent is triggered when:
- Starting research on new business concept
- Evaluating whether to pursue an idea
- Looking for differentiation opportunities
- Refining VPC/BMC based on competitive analysis

### The Mom Test Integration

Integrated The Mom Test principles across experiment guides:
- All customer conversation experiments now reference mom test framework
- Added to experiments-library overview as key methodology
- Cross-linked with customer-interviews-guide for comprehensive interview preparation

Key insight: Avoid asking "Do you think this is a good idea?" — instead ask "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]"

### Repository Reorganization

Rationale for moving context files to dedicated directory:
- Root directory was cluttered with AI instruction files
- `Context MDs for LLMs/` makes it explicit these are agent context documents
- Improves discoverability for future sessions
- Maintains backward compatibility (absolute paths in agents)

Change-log system improvements:
- Master `CHANGELOG.md` provides at-a-glance history
- Detailed session summaries in `sessions/` subfolder
- Consistent date format: `DD.MM.YY` for file names, `YYYY-MM-DD` for display
- Research project index with reference numbers (25001-26007)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Existing Solutions Analyst** — Use on next business idea validation request
2. **Apply Mom Test** — Incorporate into next customer interview experiment
3. **Session Management** — Validate /hello and /goodbye agent workflows with new change-log structure
4. **Agent Library Expansion** — Consider additional specialized agents (pricing strategist, go-to-market planner)
