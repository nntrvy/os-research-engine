## Decisions Made

### Strategic Decisions
1. **PROCEED TO HYPOTHESIS TESTING**: Strong blue ocean opportunity with no direct competitors
2. **XanhSM as primary partner**: 40% market share, 83% satisfaction, greenfield opportunity
3. **Premium pricing strategy**: $8-12 CPM justified by measurement and targeting capabilities
4. **DSP integration priority**: The Trade Desk first (60 days), Google DV360 second (120 days)

### Research Methodology Decisions
1. **Assumptions Map prioritization**: 5 EXPERIMENT (test immediately), 2 SHARE (validate), 2 DEFER, 1 MONITOR
2. **9-week experiment timeline**: Parallelized approach to reduce time to validation
3. **$3,700-4,800 experiment budget**: Conservative pre-seed budget allocation
4. **Sequential gating**: Experiment #2 failure (<30% interest) = STOP signal

### Product/Technical Decisions
1. **Hardware specification**: 10.1" Android tablets with 4G connectivity, <$200/vehicle
2. **MVP feature set**: Real-time dashboard, geo-targeting, daypart scheduling, frequency capping

## Open Questions

### Partnership & Commercial
1. **XanhSM decision-maker identification**: Who owns partnerships? Head of Partnerships vs Chief Innovation Officer?
2. **Revenue share negotiation**: Will 70/30 split be acceptable? What's market standard?
3. **Hardware installation logistics**: Can we install 1,000 tablets in 90 days? What's depot capacity?
4. **Exclusivity terms**: Will XanhSM grant category exclusivity for in-taxi screens?

### Product & Technical
1. **DSP integration complexity**: Can we achieve <100ms response time for real-time bidding on cellular?
2. **Screen uptime reliability**: What's realistic uptime on Vietnam's cellular networks (4G/5G)?
3. **GPS data access**: Will XanhSM share real-time GPS coordinates for geo-targeting?
4. **Content management**: How to handle ad content review/approval at scale?

### Market & Customer

2. **Agency buying process**: Do agencies have programmatic DOOH budget lines already?
3. **CPM price sensitivity**: What's the actual ceiling before advertisers reject premium?
4. **Dynamic creative adoption**: Will Vietnamese brands invest in location-based creative or prefer static?

### Financial & Operational
1. **Driver incentive optimization**: What's minimum acceptable monthly payment to drivers?
2. **Hardware cost reduction**: Can we negotiate <$150/vehicle at 5,000+ unit scale?
3. **Fill rate assumptions**: Is 4 ad spots/hour sustainable, or will we have unsold inventory?
4. **Churn prediction**: What % of taxis will leave network monthly (driver turnover)?

## Next Steps (For @update-me Agent)

1. **Execute Experiment #1 (Media Buyer Survey)**: Build contact list of 50 media buyers at GroupM, Dentsu, Publicis, Omnicom, IPG Vietnam via LinkedIn. Create 5-question survey on feature priorities. Target 30+ responses in 2 weeks. Budget: $0.

2. **Initiate Experiment #3 (XanhSM Partnership LOI)**: Research XanhSM decision-makers (Head of Partnerships, Chief Innovation Officer). Secure warm introduction through investor network or EV ecosystem contacts. Prepare partnership pitch deck with revenue model (70/30 split, 1,000 taxis). Budget: $0.

3. **Prepare Experiment #2 materials (Agency Interviews)**: Draft 1-page pilot proposal PDF with XanhSM partnership value proposition. Create Mom Test interview script focused on budget commitment questions. Set up Calendly scheduling. Acquire 12x $40 Grab vouchers for participant incentives. Budget: $500.

4. **Validate CPM pricing assumptions (Experiment #4 prep)**: Research Vietnam OOH CPM benchmarks (billboards, bus shelters, elevator screens). Identify 10 target advertisers from FMCG/retail sectors currently spending on OOH. Prepare 8-page pilot package PDF with screen mockups and pricing comparison. Budget: $1,200 ($800 legal, $400 design).

5. **Technical feasibility scoping (Experiment #5 prep)**: Register developer accounts for The Trade Desk and Google DV360. Review API documentation for both platforms. Document data requirements (GPS, impression tracking, real-time bidding). Set up AWS dev environment for integration POC. Budget: $2,000 (AWS + development time).
