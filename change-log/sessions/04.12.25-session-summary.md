## Decisions Made

1. **Research methodology validated**: Social listening via VozForums and Facebook groups provides high-quality, authentic customer pain point data
2. **Target market confirmed**: Vietnamese middle-class families with existing insurance policies experiencing buyer's remorse
3. **Blue ocean opportunity identified**: Transparent, simple insurance products or independent advisory services could address massive trust gap
4. **Repository structure decision**: Moved playbooks from `0-market-research/` to `0-market-research-guide/` for consistency with other guides

## Research & Data Collected

### Primary Sources
- **VozForums threads:** 15+ discussion threads analyzing contract terms, sharing experiences
- **Facebook groups:** 10+ groups with 50K-123K members, 20+ high-engagement posts
- **News articles:** VnExpress, CafeF, Tien Phong, Thanh Nien coverage of insurance crisis
- **Real customer quotes:** 20+ direct quotes in Vietnamese with English translations

### Research Methods
- Web scraping via Bright Data MCP server (VozForums, Facebook, news sites)
- Keyword analysis: "lừa đảo", "mất tiền", "claim denial", "bancassurance"
- Sentiment analysis: Frequency of negative emotional indicators
- Engagement metrics: Tracking reactions and comments on complaint posts

### Data Validation
- Cross-referenced findings across multiple independent sources
- Verified statistics from industry reports (19% decline, 3M contracts voided)
- Collected real quotes with Vietnamese original + translation for authenticity

## Open Questions

1. **Regulatory environment**: What are the actual enforcement mechanisms? Why do 3+ month refund delays go unpunished?
2. **Agent incentive structures**: What commissions do agents earn that drives aggressive mis-selling?
3. **Claim approval rates**: What percentage of claims are denied? Industry-wide vs company-specific data?
4. **Willingness to pay**: Would customers pay for independent advisory/review services? At what price point?
5. **Distribution alternatives**: Could digital-first insurance bypass corrupt agent networks effectively?
6. **Competitor intelligence**: Are any companies already addressing these pain points successfully?

## Next Steps (For @update-me Agent)

1. **Conduct customer interviews**: Reach out to 10-15 people who posted in Facebook insurance complaint groups to validate findings and uncover deeper insights into decision-making process

2. **Map regulatory landscape**: Research Vietnam Insurance Supervisory Authority (ISA) enforcement powers, complaint resolution processes, and bancassurance regulations to understand why systemic fraud persists

3. **Design hypothesis prioritization**: Create testable hypotheses using the Assumptions Map framework (Desirability > Feasibility > Viability) based on today's social listening findings

4. **Build landing page experiment**: Test desirability of "transparent 1-page insurance contract review service" - measure signup rate, willingness to pay, and customer segment validation

5. **Analyze competitor positioning**: Research existing insurance companies and InsurTech startups in Vietnam to identify white space opportunities and learn from others' attempts to solve transparency issues
