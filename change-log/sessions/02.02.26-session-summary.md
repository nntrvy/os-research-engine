## Findings & Discoveries

### The Mom Test Framework

Researched Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test" — a framework for conducting customer interviews that avoid false validation.

**Core Principles:**
1. Talk about their life, not your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past, not hypotheticals about the future
3. Talk less and listen more (80/20 rule)

**Key Concepts Added:**
- 3 types of bad data: Compliments, Fluff, Feature Requests
- Commitment currencies: Time, Reputation, Money
- Warning signs of bad vs good data
- Practical question examples (good vs bad)

## Decisions Made

### The Mom Test Integration
- **Created standalone file** rather than merging into existing `customer-interviews-guide.md`
- **Rationale**: The Mom Test is a distinct mental model that applies beyond just interviews (surveys, feedback, prototypes)
- **Cross-referenced** both files to work together: Strategyzer methodology (detailed questions) + Mom Test (avoiding false validation)

### Change-log Reorganization
- **Created `sessions/` subfolder** for detailed summaries
- **Created concise `CHANGELOG.md`** with one-line entries and links
- **Rationale**: Quick lookup via CHANGELOG, deep dive via session files

## Open Questions

1. Should we create a "Mom Test checklist" as a separate printable PDF?
2. Should the hypothesizer agent automatically flag hypotheses that require Mom Test-style validation?
3. Would a Vietnamese translation of key Mom Test concepts be useful for local teams?

## Next Steps

1. **Test Mom Test integration**: Apply framework in next customer interview experiment
2. **Consider AI agent enhancement**: Add Mom Test principles to interview analysis agents
3. **Review experiment library**: Ensure experiments 05, 06, 08, 29, 30 reference The Mom Test
