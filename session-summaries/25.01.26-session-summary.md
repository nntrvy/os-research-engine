### Social Listening Insights (Voz.vn, Tinhte.vn)

Key pain points discovered from Vietnamese forums:
- **Insurance agents**: "Tuyển ồ ạt, không đào tạo bài bản" (mass recruitment, no training)
- **Bancassurance coercion**: "Ép mua bảo hiểm mới được giải ngân" (forced to buy for loans)
- **Claims rejection**: "Không cần thiết về mặt y khoa" (rejected as not medically necessary)
- **Mis-selling**: Agents position insurance as savings, not risk management
- **Pre-existing conditions**: People with conditions cannot buy private insurance

### Blue Ocean Strategy Analysis

Recommended focus: **Embedded Micro-Insurance Platform**
- Target: 67% informal workers (Grab drivers, street vendors)
- Distribution: MoMo, ZaloPay, Grab, Shopee checkout integration
- Price: VND 5K-50K micro-policies
- Differentiation: 24-hour AI claims, radical transparency, no agents

### AVEP vs OSR Comparison

| Dimension | AVEP | OS Research |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Core Question | "Can we execute this better?" | "Should we bet on this?" |
| Target | Large enterprises | Early-stage startups |
| Model | Consulting → Venture | Validation → Venture Capital |
| Revenue | B2B contracts (VND 40-400bn) | Investment returns (100x exits) |

### Content Strategy Development

**Philosophy:** "10-Year Journal" documenting the journey to become Vietnam's #1 venture studio

**4 Content Pillars:**
1. **Field Notes (25%)**: Stories from problem discovery (essays, documentary videos, interviews)
2. **Build Log (20%)**: Prototypes, failures, iterations (case studies, post-mortems)
3. **Blue Ocean Library (30%)**: Deep dives on market creators (Nintendo, Tesla, etc.) + Vietnam opportunities
4. **The Playbook (25%)**: Open-source methodology (VPC, BMC, experiments, frameworks)

**Key Strategic Decisions:**
- Primary channel: Blog + Newsletter (Substack or self-hosted)
- Secondary: YouTube (playbook tutorials, field documentaries)
- Weekly newsletter: "Weekly Dispatch" every Friday
- Budget: 50M VND/month for Content Lead
- IP Education Initiative: Aligned with Vietnamese government programs

**Three Iterations:**
- **v1.0**: Initial documentary-style approach (40% Field Notes, 30% Build Log, 20% Founder Files, 10% Playbook)
- **v1.1**: Rebalanced to prioritize Blue Ocean content (25% Field Notes, 20% Build Log, 30% Blue Ocean Library, 25% Playbook)
- **v1.2**: Streamlined for content team execution - removed fluff, made tables-focused, added clear 90-day plan with checkboxes

## 5 Critical Hypotheses Generated

### Priority 1: EXPERIMENT (Test Immediately)

**H1: Willingness to Buy Micro-Insurance** [Desirability]
- Informal workers will opt-in to VND 10K-50K hospital coverage at e-wallet checkout
- Success: >5% opt-in rate

**H2: Trust Through Transparency** [Desirability]
- Consumers will buy if claims approval rates are publicly displayed (>85%) and payouts occur within 24 hours
- Success: Transparency variant 2x higher CTR

**H3: Pre-existing Conditions Inclusion** [Desirability]
- Adults with pre-existing conditions will pay VND 100K-200K/month for inclusive coverage
- Success: 60%+ willing at 100K/month

### Priority 3: DEFER (Test After Validation)

**H4: Unit Economics** [Viability]
- Micro-insurance at VND 10K-50K/week can achieve combined ratio below 90%

**H5: Partnership Terms** [Viability]
- E-wallet partners will accept <20% commission

## Testing Plan

| Week | Hypothesis | Test Method | Cost |
|------|------------|-------------|------|
| 1-2 | H1 | E-wallet A/B or Fake door ad | VND 10M |
| 2-3 | H2 | Landing page variants | VND 5M |
| 3-4 | H3 | Survey + WTP analysis | VND 5M |
| 5+ | H4, H5 | Pilot program | TBD |

**Total validation budget: VND 20-50M ($800-2,000 USD)**

## Decisions Made

### Strategic Decisions (Market Research)
1. **FOCUS ON INSURANCE TRUST CRISIS**: Highest Blue Ocean score (90/100), clearest non-customer segment
2. **Target informal workers**: 67% of workforce, massive underserved market
3. **Embedded distribution**: Partner with e-wallets (MoMo, ZaloPay) rather than building direct channels
4. **Micro-policy model**: VND 5K-50K vs traditional VND 500K+/month

### Strategic Decisions (Content Strategy)
1. **Primary channel: Written content over video initially**: Blog + Newsletter as foundation, YouTube as secondary
2. **Balance Blue Ocean content with Field Notes**: 30% Blue Ocean Library (rebalanced from 10% Playbook in v1.0)
3. **Open-source everything**: No paywalls, all frameworks free
4. **Budget allocation**: 50M VND/month for one Content Lead (vs initial 30-50M for separate roles)
5. **IP Education Initiative**: Align content with Vietnamese government IP programs for ecosystem impact

### Research Methodology
1. Used osr-researcher for comprehensive market analysis
2. Applied Blue Ocean Strategy (Four Actions Framework) via blue-ocean-strategist
3. Social listening on Voz.vn, Tinhte.vn via Bright Data MCP
4. Hypothesis generation using /hypothesizer skill

## Open Questions

### Insurance Opportunity
1. Which e-wallet partner to approach first? (MoMo vs ZaloPay vs Grab)
2. What insurance license structure is required? (Partner with existing insurer vs own license)
3. How to build actuarial models for informal worker risk profiles?
4. What's the regulatory stance on AI-based claims assessment?

### Validation
1. How to access Grab driver contact lists for survey?
2. Which Facebook groups have highest concentration of informal workers?
3. What's the minimum viable pilot size for statistical significance?

### Content Strategy Execution
1. Which platform for blog/newsletter? (Substack vs self-hosted Ghost vs WordPress)
2. How to recruit Content Lead with both writing AND video skills in Vietnam at 50M VND/month?
3. Should we start with Vietnamese or English content? (or bilingual from day 1?)
4. How to measure "founders using our playbook" success metric practically?
5. Which Blue Ocean case studies to prioritize for first 20? (Vietnam examples vs global classics?)

## Next Steps (For @update-me Agent)

### Content Strategy (Priority)
1. **Choose blog/newsletter platform**: Evaluate Substack vs Ghost vs WordPress - consider Vietnamese language support, cost, analytics, and ease of migration
2. **Draft job description for Content Lead**: 50M VND/month role requiring essay writing, video editing, diagram creation, Vietnamese fluency, English proficiency, and comfort with field research
3. **Create content calendar template**: Structure for weekly cadence (Mon-Tue research, Wed-Thu filming, Fri newsletter/publishing) with pillar distribution (25% Field Notes, 20% Build Log, 30% Blue Ocean, 25% Playbook)
4. **Audit existing playbooks**: Review 0-market-research-guide/, 1-hypotheses-guide/, 2-experiment-guide/ to identify what needs additional documentation or templates before content launch
5. **Select first 5 Blue Ocean case studies to write**: Choose mix of global classics (Nintendo Wii, Southwest Airlines) and Vietnam opportunities (embedded insurance, DOOH taxi ads) for Month 1 deep dives

### Insurance Opportunity Validation (Deferred Until Content Strategy Launched)
1. Design and launch fake door ad test for H1 (target Grab drivers on Facebook)
2. Build landing page variants for H2 transparency test
3. Deploy survey for H3 pre-existing conditions segment
4. Compile results, decide go/no-go on Insurance Trust Crisis opportunity
5. If validated, initiate partner conversations (MoMo, ZaloPay, Grab)
