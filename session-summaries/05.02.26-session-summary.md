# Session Summary - 05.02.26

## Session Overview
- **Duration:** Brief session (approximately 30 minutes)
- **Primary Focus:** Knowledge management infrastructure improvements
- **Key Outcome:** Standardized research session management across all context documents

## Findings & Discoveries

### Knowledge Management System Gap Identified
- Multiple AI agents (Claude, Gemini, custom agents) lacked consistent guidance on research folder management
- Risk of creating duplicate research folders for related topics
- No standardized README.md structure for research projects
- Missing version control pattern for research context documents

### Solution Implemented: Research Session Management Protocol
Added comprehensive "Research Session Management" section to 4 critical context documents with 3-step workflow:

**Step 1: Check for Existing Research**
- ALWAYS check `research-outputs/` before starting new research
- Search for related topics by keywords/name

**Step 2: Add to Existing OR Create New Folder**
- If related research exists: add to existing folder, update README.md changelog
- If new research: create `{YY}{NNN}-{project-name}/` folder with structured README.md

**Step 3: Keep Master Context Updated**
- README.md serves as single source of truth for each project
- Include: Project metadata, Overview, Key Findings table, Folder Structure, Changelog table

### README.md Template Structure Defined
```markdown
# {REFNUM}: {Project Name}

**Project:** {Name}
**Type:** {Research Type}
**Status:** {Current Status}
**Created:** {DD.MM.YY}

| `SESSION-CHANGELOG.md` | Created | Blockchain-style session tracking system (initialized) |

## Decisions Made

### 1. Adopt "Master README.md" Pattern
**Decision:** Each research folder MUST have a README.md that serves as the single source of truth
**Rationale:** Enables agents to quickly understand project context without reading all files, reduces redundant research, improves knowledge continuity

### 2. Standardize Across All AI Agents
**Decision:** Add identical Research Session Management section to CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, and AGENTS.md
**Rationale:** Ensures consistent behavior regardless of which AI agent is used for research

### 3. Implement Session Changelog as Blockchain
**Decision:** Create immutable SESSION-CHANGELOG.md with newest-first block structure
**Rationale:** Provides audit trail, enables quick review of project history, blockchain metaphor reinforces immutability

### 4. Store Session Summaries in Dedicated Folder
**Decision:** Create `session-summaries/` directory with `DD.MM.YY-session-summary.md` naming
**Rationale:** Keeps root directory clean, makes historical sessions easily discoverable, follows existing date-prefix convention

## Research & Data Collected

### Existing Research Status Review
- **26009-bee-digital-v1/**: BeeVN-Digital insurance partnership research (active)
- **26010-millennial-dad-bonding/**: Father-son bonding platform research (contains vpc-bmc-v2.md)
- **26011-vinfast-insurance-markets/**: Vinfast international insurance market analysis (8 files including regulations docs for DRC, Kazakhstan, Philippines)

### Untracked Files Identified
- `03.02.26-millennial-dad-bonding-solutions.md` (competitive analysis, should be moved to 26010 folder)
- Word documents in 26009 folder with date prefixes (03.02.25, 14.12.25)
- Python scripts for docx generation in 26011 folder

### File Deletions Detected
- `research-outputs/26009-bee-digital-v1/bee-digital-market-research-report.docx` (deleted)
- `research-outputs/26009-bee-digital-v1/outputs/.claude/agents/goodbye.md` (deleted)
- `research-outputs/26009-bee-digital-v1/outputs/.claude/agents/hello.md` (deleted)

## Open Questions

### Should Loose Root Files Be Moved to Research Folders?
- `03.02.26-millennial-dad-bonding-solutions.md` logically belongs in `26010-millennial-dad-bonding/`
- Should we enforce a policy of NO loose research files in root?

### Do Existing Research Folders Need README.md Backfills?
- Many existing folders (26001-26011) may lack the new README.md structure
- Should we proactively create master README.md files for all existing projects?

### Should Python Scripts Live in Research Folders?
- `create_osr_docx.py` and `generate_beevn_report.py` are project-specific
- Alternative: Create a `scripts/` directory for all automation tools

### How to Handle Word Documents with Date Prefixes?
- `03.02.25 - bee-digital-market-research-report.docx` uses spaces in filename
- Convention says `DD.MM.YY-topic-name.docx` (hyphens, no spaces)
- Should we enforce filename conventions on .docx files too?

## Next Steps (For @update-me Agent)

1. **Backfill README.md for Existing Research Folders**: Create master README.md files for research folders 26001-26011 using the new template structure, ensuring each has Project metadata, Overview, Key Findings, Folder Structure, and Changelog

2. **Organize Loose Research Files**: Move `03.02.26-millennial-dad-bonding-solutions.md` from root to `research-outputs/26010-millennial-dad-bonding/` and update that folder's README.md accordingly

3. **Audit Research Folder Structures**: Review all folders in `research-outputs/` to ensure they follow the `{YY}{NNN}-{project-name}/` naming convention and contain properly structured documentation

4. **Create Script Organization Strategy**: Evaluate whether Python scripts (`create_osr_docx.py`, `generate_beevn_report.py`) should remain in research folders or move to a centralized `scripts/` directory

5. **Enforce Filename Conventions**: Rename Word documents with spaces (e.g., `03.02.25 - bee-digital...docx`) to use hyphen format (`03.02.25-bee-digital...docx`) for consistency with markdown file naming
