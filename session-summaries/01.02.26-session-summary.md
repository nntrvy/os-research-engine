## Findings & Discoveries

### Market Research Insights (26007 - Child Development Platform)

**Market Size Discovery:**
- Original TAM: 2.5M diagnosed children (autism/ADHD/delays)
- **Refined TAM: 12M all children ages 2-10** (expanded from "intervention platform" to "universal development tracking")
- Critical insight: **80% of children with delays are UNDIAGNOSED** - parents search at 18 months but no solutions exist until age 3+

**Blue Ocean Opportunity - The 18-Month Gap:**
- Parents notice delays at 18 months but face:
  - 0-18 months: No solutions, just Google and anxiety
  - 18-24 months: Months waiting for diagnosis appointment
  - 24-36 months: Centers have 6-12 month waitlists
  - 3+ years: Start intervention, but **golden window (before age 3) already MISSED**
- **No competitor serves this gap** - massive blue ocean space

**Financial Burden Validation:**
- Families spend 8.5-11.5M VND/month (~$340-460 USD) on intervention centers
- Some families report "burning 20M VND/month" (~$800 USD)
- Total lifetime cost: 200M+ VND per child
- **Zero health insurance coverage** for autism/ADHD in Vietnam despite 90% national coverage

**Digital Opportunity:**
- Smartphone penetration: 78.8% (79.8M users)
- Social media: 76.2M users (75.2% penetration)
- Middle class projected to reach 55% by 2030
- Real earnings growth: 4.8% annually until 2029

**Social Listening Findings:**
- Parents express "drowning in billions VND debt"
- School rejection trauma: "kicked from 10+ schools"
- Marriages collapse from financial/emotional stress
- Desperate need for affordable home intervention guidance

**Business Model Innovation:**
- **3-Tier Lifetime Product:**
  - Tier 1: Early Warning (0-24 months) - 250K VND/month
  - Tier 2: Intervention (18 months - 5 years) - 750K VND/month
  - Tier 3: School Prep (4-6 years) - 1M VND/month
- **LTV:CAC improved from 11.25x to 72x** through repositioning

**Competitive Landscape:**
- A365.vn: Outdated, passive, no AI personalization
- Physical Centers: Unaffordable (5-15M/month), waitlists, urban only
- Otsimo (International): No Vietnamese, expensive ($120-230/year)
- Pediatricians: Only see child 4x/year, can't track daily progress

### Content Strategist Work Scope (26003)

**Role Allocation Refinement:**
- Research & Analysis: 20%
- Content Transformation: 20%
- Company Voice: 30%
- Internal Operations: 30%

**2-Month Roadmap Created:**

## Decisions Made

### Strategic Pivot for 26007 (Child Development Platform)

**Decision:** Expand from "special needs intervention platform" to "universal development tracking platform"

**Rationale:**
1. **10x larger market:** 2.5M → 12M children
2. **Lower stigma:** "Smart development tracking" vs "Autism intervention"
3. **Earlier entry point:** 18 months vs 2-3 years post-diagnosis
4. **Blue ocean space:** No competitor serves the 18-month gap
5. **Natural upsell path:** Free/low-cost screening → premium intervention tiers

**Impact on Business Model:**
- TAM: 2.5M → 12M children
- LTV:CAC: 11.25x → 72x
- Positioning: "Every parent worries" vs "Only special needs families"
- Revenue model: 3-tier lifetime product (250K → 750K → 1M VND/month)

### Content Strategist Role Allocation

**Decision:** Split role into 4 clear areas with specific time allocation

**Rationale:**
1. Research (20%) - Feeds all content with real insights
2. Content Transformation (20%) - Converts research to public education
3. Company Voice (30%) - Largest allocation for brand building
4. Internal Operations (30%) - Strong systems enable external consistency

**Implementation:** Created 2-month roadmap with weekly activities and deliverables

## Open Questions

### For 26007 (Child Development Platform)

1. **Regulatory Risk:** Does offering "AI screening" require medical licensing in Vietnam? What are legal boundaries for "development tracking" vs "diagnosis"?

2. **Content Sourcing:** How to acquire/validate 365 daily intervention activities? Partner with Vietnam autism centers or license international curricula?

3. **AI Model Training:** What dataset exists for Vietnamese children's developmental milestones? Can we use international data or need Vietnam-specific training?

4. **Pricing Validation:** Will middle-class families pay 250K-1M VND/month? Need to test willingness-to-pay vs current 5-15M VND center costs.

5. **School Integration:** Can we create partnerships with Vietnamese schools to reduce rejection rates for our users?

6. **Insurance Coverage:** Any pathway to get platform costs covered by Vietnam health insurance in future?

### For 26003 (Content Strategy)

1. **Platform Priority:** Should LinkedIn be primary channel given B2B startup focus, or Facebook for Vietnam reach?

2. **Content Language:** Vietnamese only, English only, or bilingual strategy?

3. **Founder Voice:** Will content come from specific founder voices or generic "OS Research" brand?

4. **Community Building:** Create separate community (Slack/Discord) or leverage existing Vietnam startup groups?

5. **Measurement:** What are success metrics for content? (Engagement, leads, brand awareness, thought leadership?)
