# Business Model Design

A comprehensive guide to designing business models using the Business Model Canvas.

## What is the Business Model Canvas?

The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic tool that helps us plan, discuss, design, and invent new business models. With the BMC, you can visually map out your entire business model in one image to quickly describe how any business **creates, delivers, and captures value**.

This works for startup entrepreneurs just as well as for the most senior executives.

## Block-by-Block Guide

### 1. Customer Segments

**Question:** Who are we creating value for?

Customer Segments define the different groups of people or organizations a business aims to reach and serve. This includes both users (who use the product) and paying customers (who pay for it) — they may or may not be the same.

**Types of Customer Segments:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Mass Market** | No distinction between segments | Consumer electronics |
| **Niche Market** | Specialized, specific segments | Luxury goods |
| **Segmented** | Slightly different needs | Bank: retail vs. wealthy clients |
| **Diversified** | Unrelated segments | Amazon: consumers + AWS developers |
| **Multi-sided** | Two+ interdependent segments | Platform: riders + drivers |

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Be specific about demographics, behaviors, and needs
- Distinguish between users and paying customers if different

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good Sticky Notes:
• "Urban homeowners, 30-45, first renovation"
• "SMB owners, 10-50 employees, no HR team"
• "Parents of children aged 3-6, dual income"

❌ Bad Sticky Notes:
• "Everyone"
• "People who need our product"
• "Users"
```

---

### 2. Value Propositions

**Question:** What value do we deliver to the customer?

Value Propositions describe the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment. This is the reason customers choose one company over another.

**Value Can Be:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Newness** | Satisfying new needs customers didn't know they had |
| **Performance** | Improving product/service performance |
| **Customization** | Tailoring to specific needs |
| **Getting the Job Done** | Helping customers complete a task |
| **Design** | Superior aesthetics |
| **Brand/Status** | Value from using a specific brand |
| **Price** | Similar value at lower price |
| **Cost Reduction** | Helping customers reduce costs |
| **Risk Reduction** | Reducing risks customers face |
| **Accessibility** | Making something available to new customers |
| **Convenience** | Making things easier or more convenient |

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Focus on the benefit, not the feature
- Be specific about what makes you different

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good Sticky Notes:
• "Stress-free renovation, guaranteed price"
• "Find contractors in 24h, not 2 weeks"
• "Zero paperwork health insurance"

❌ Bad Sticky Notes:
• "Best product"
• "Great service"
• "We help customers"
```

### 3. Channels

**Question:** How do we reach our Customer Segments and deliver our Value Proposition?

**Channel Types:**

| Type | Description | Trade-offs |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Direct** | Own sales force, website | Higher margin, more control, higher cost |
| **Indirect** | Partner stores, wholesalers | Lower margin, broader reach |
| **Owned** | Channels you control | Full control, requires investment |
| **Partner** | Channels others control | Leveraged reach, less control |

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Map the full customer journey
- Be specific about each touchpoint

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good Sticky Notes:

**Right Side = Value Creation & Delivery**
- Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams
- Focus: Desirability (Do customers want this?)

**Left Side = Infrastructure & Costs**
- Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partners, Cost Structure
- Focus: Feasibility (Can we build this?) and Viability (Can we make money?)

## Writing Guidelines for Sticky Notes

Every sticky note on the BMC must be:

### The 4 Rules

| Rule | Description | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Short** | 3-7 words maximum | Forces clarity, fits on sticky note |
| **Specific** | No vague statements | Enables validation and action |
| **Clear** | Anyone can understand | Enables team alignment |
| **Accurate** | Based on evidence | Prevents wishful thinking |

### Examples by Block

| Block | ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Customer Segments | "Users" | "Urban homeowners, first renovation" |
| Value Propositions | "Great service" | "Find contractor in 24h, guaranteed" |
| Channels | "Online" | "Instagram ads → Landing page → App" |
| Customer Relationships | "Support" | "Self-service + chat + human escalation" |
| Revenue Streams | "Make money" | "15% commission per project" |
| Key Resources | "Technology" | "Matching algorithm, contractor DB" |
| Key Activities | "Operations" | "Contractor vetting, quality control" |
| Key Partners | "Partners" | "Insurance provider, payment processor" |
| Cost Structure | "Expenses" | "Tech: $20K/mo, Marketing: 25% revenue" |

### Self-Check Questions

Before adding a sticky note, ask:
1. Is this specific enough that I could test or measure it?
2. Would a stranger understand what this means?
3. Is this based on evidence or assumption?
4. Does this fit in 3-7 words?

## How to Fill Out the BMC

### Recommended Order

1. **Customer Segments** — Start with who you serve
2. **Value Propositions** — What value you deliver to them
3. **Channels** — How you reach and deliver
4. **Customer Relationships** — How you interact
5. **Revenue Streams** — How you capture value
6. **Key Resources** — What you need to deliver
7. **Key Activities** — What you must do well
8. **Key Partners** — Who helps you
9. **Cost Structure** — What it costs

### Tips for Each Session

**First Pass (30 minutes)**
- Fill out all blocks with initial assumptions
- Don't overthink — use sticky notes, not essays
- Mark assumptions vs. validated facts

**Second Pass (After Research)**
- Update blocks based on customer interviews
- Remove or modify invalidated assumptions
- Add specificity where you've learned more

**Ongoing Updates**
- The BMC is a living document
- Update as you test and learn
- Version your canvases to track evolution

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Starting with Solution
**Wrong:** "We have a great app" → then finding customers
**Right:** Customer Segments → Value Propositions → Solution

### 2. Vague Sticky Notes
**Wrong:** "Revenue" / "Customers" / "Marketing"
**Right:** Specific, testable statements

### 3. Ignoring Block Connections
**Wrong:** Revenue streams that don't connect to value propositions
**Right:** Every block should logically connect

### 4. Treating It as Static
**Wrong:** Fill once, never update
**Right:** Iterate based on learning

### 5. Overcomplicating
**Wrong:** 20 sticky notes per block
**Right:** 3-5 focused sticky notes per block

## BMC + VPC Integration

The Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas work together:

```

**Workflow:**
1. Complete Customer Profile (VPC) → feeds into Customer Segments (BMC)
2. Complete Value Map (VPC) → feeds into Value Propositions (BMC)
3. Build out remaining BMC blocks around this foundation

---

## Final Note

A strong Business Model Canvas is critical — but it's built on assumptions.

> **The BMC is a hypothesis, not a plan. Every sticky note should be tested.**

Use the BMC alongside the Value Proposition Canvas and structured hypothesis testing to maximize your chances of building something customers actually want — and that makes business sense.
