# Value Proposition Design

A comprehensive guide to creating products and services customers actually want.

---

## The Problem

Every day, companies launch new products and services with the hope of improving customers' lives.

But the reality is stark:

> **72% of new product and service innovations fail to deliver on expectations.**

In simple terms, customers don't care about 7 out of 10 new products introduced to the market.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

## Our Approach: Designing with the Customer in Mind

We use a tool that helps us intentionally visualize, design, and test how we create value for customers.

It's called the **Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)**.

The VPC is composed of two key parts:

1. **The Customer Profile** — Understanding who we're designing for
2. **The Value Map** — Articulating how we create value

## 1. Customer Profile

The Customer Profile helps us map customer reality. It forces us to deeply understand who we're designing for before we start building.

### Three Components

| Component | Description | Types |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Jobs** | What customers are trying to get done | Functional, Social, Emotional |
| **Pains** | Negative outcomes customers experience | Frustrations, Risks, Obstacles, Dissatisfaction |
| **Gains** | Positive outcomes customers seek | Results, Benefits, Aspirations |

### Jobs: What Customers Are Trying to Do

Jobs are the tasks customers are trying to accomplish, problems they're trying to solve, or needs they're trying to satisfy.

**Functional Jobs**
- Specific tasks or problems to solve
- *Example: "Renovate my kitchen"*

**Social Jobs**
- How customers want to be perceived by others
- *Example: "Impress guests with my home"*

**Emotional Jobs**
- How customers want to feel
- *Example: "Feel confident about my design choices"*

### Pains: What Frustrates Customers

Pains describe anything that annoys customers before, during, or after trying to get a job done.

- **Undesired outcomes**: Things that don't work or have negative side effects
- **Obstacles**: Things that prevent getting started or slow progress
- **Risks**: Potential negative outcomes customers worry about
- **Dissatisfaction**: Current solutions that frustrate or underperform

### Gains: What Customers Want to Achieve

Gains describe the outcomes and benefits customers want. They can be:

- **Required**: Essential outcomes without which a solution wouldn't work
- **Expected**: Basic outcomes customers anticipate
- **Desired**: Outcomes customers would love but don't expect
- **Unexpected**: Outcomes beyond customer imagination

### Example: People Who Self-Manage Home Renovation

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Important Note

> The Customer Profile is not a fixed snapshot. It's a map that becomes clearer over time as we gather more insights through interviews, research, and real-world testing.

---

## 2. Value Map

The Value Map helps us articulate how we create value. It's our response to what we learned in the Customer Profile.

### Three Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Products & Services** | The offerings our value proposition is built on |
| **Pain Relievers** | How we eliminate, reduce, or minimize customer pains |
| **Gain Creators** | How we enable, increase, or maximize customer gains |

### Products & Services

A list of what we offer. This is simply an inventory — it includes:
- Physical products
- Digital products
- Services
- Experiences
- Support offerings

### Pain Relievers

Pain relievers describe how our products and services alleviate specific customer pains.

Good pain relievers explicitly address pains from the Customer Profile:

| Customer Pain | Pain Reliever |
|---------------|---------------|
| "Don't know fair prices" | Price transparency tool with market comparisons |
| "Fear of getting scammed" | Verified contractor network with reviews |
| "Projects go over budget" | Real-time budget tracking and alerts |

### Gain Creators

Gain creators describe how we produce outcomes and benefits customers expect, desire, or would be surprised by.

| Customer Gain | Gain Creator |
|---------------|--------------|
| "Peace of mind" | Project manager assigned to every job |
| "Beautiful result" | Design consultation included |
| "On-time completion" | Milestone tracking with guarantees |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How We Use the Value Map

We use the Value Map to **design, test, and iterate** our value proposition until we figure out what truly resonates with customers.

---

## 3. Finding the Fit

**Product-market fit happens when there is a clear connection between:**

- What matters to customers (jobs, pains, gains)
- How our product eases those pains and creates meaningful gains

```

│   Creators      │                    │                 │
│                 │                    │                 │
└─────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
```

### The Focus Principle

> **A great value proposition does not try to do everything — it focuses on the essential jobs, pains, and gains, and addresses them exceptionally well.**

Even if a Customer Profile contains a wide range of insights, the Value Map helps us focus our effort:

- It highlights **what we intend to solve**
- It clarifies **how we intend to solve it**
- It forces us to make **deliberate trade-offs**

### Three Stages of Fit

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Problem-Solution Fit** | Evidence that customers care about certain jobs, pains, and gains — and that our value proposition addresses them |
| **Product-Market Fit** | Evidence that our products and services actually create value in the market |
| **Business Model Fit** | Evidence that our value proposition can be embedded in a profitable, scalable business model |

---

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Start with the Customer Profile

Never start with your solution. Always start by deeply understanding:
- Who is your customer?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What frustrates them?
- What do they aspire to?

### Step 2: Prioritize Jobs, Pains, and Gains

Not all jobs are equally important. Not all pains are equally severe. Rank them:
- Which jobs are most critical?
- Which pains are most intense?
- Which gains would create the most value?

### Step 3: Design Your Value Map

Create pain relievers and gain creators that directly address priority items:
- Be specific about which pains you relieve
- Be explicit about which gains you create
- Accept that you can't address everything

### Step 4: Check for Fit

Ask yourself:
- Does our value proposition address what customers care about most?
- Are we trying to do too much?
- Can we articulate our fit in one sentence?

### Step 5: Test and Iterate

The canvas is a hypothesis. Validate it through:
- Customer interviews
- Prototype testing
- Market experiments
- Real-world feedback

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Starting with the Solution**
Don't fill in the Value Map first. Always begin with the Customer Profile.

**2. Listing Features Instead of Value**
Products and services are not the value proposition. Pain relievers and gain creators are.

**3. Trying to Address Everything**
Focus on what matters most. A diluted value proposition resonates with no one.

**4. Assuming Instead of Validating**
Your Customer Profile is a hypothesis until validated by real customers.

**5. Static Thinking**
The canvas should evolve as you learn. Treat it as a living document.

---

## Final Note

A strong Value Proposition Canvas is critical — but it's not enough on its own.

> **Even the most compelling value proposition can fail if the Business Model is flawed.**

That's why we must continuously test:
- **What we build** (the value proposition)
- **How we bring it to market** (the business model)

The VPC is one tool in a broader experimentation system. Use it alongside the Business Model Canvas and structured testing to maximize your chances of success.

## Quick Reference

### Customer Profile Questions

| Component | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|
| Jobs | What is the customer trying to get done? What tasks are they performing? |
| Pains | What annoys them? What risks do they fear? What's not working? |
| Gains | What would success look like? What would delight them? |

### Value Map Questions

| Component | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|
| Products & Services | What do we offer? What can customers buy or use? |
| Pain Relievers | How do we eliminate or reduce specific pains? |
| Gain Creators | How do we create specific outcomes customers want? |

### Fit Questions

- Which pains are we relieving? How intensely?
- Which gains are we creating? How substantially?
- Is there a clear match between our map and their profile?
- Can customers immediately see the value?
