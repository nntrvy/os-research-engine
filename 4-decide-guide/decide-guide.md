# Decide Guide

A comprehensive context file for AI agents working on decision-making tasks after experiments and learning.

## What is Decide?

**Turning insights into action.**

Learning faster than everyone else is no longer enough. You need to put that learning into action, because what you've learned has an expiration date.

If you feel like this is happening faster than any time in recorded history, you may be correct. People today are exposed to more information in a year than those in the early 1900s experienced in a lifetime. Both markets and technology move so quickly that the insights you've gained can expire within months, weeks, or even days.

### Action Definition

For the purposes of testing business ideas, we define action as:

- **Next steps** to make progress with testing and de-risking a business idea
- **Informed decisions** based on collected insights
- **Decisions to abandon, change, and/or continue** testing a business idea

## The Three Decision Options

After running experiments and gathering insights, you face one of three decisions:

```
                                    ┌─────────────────┐
                                    │   📍 PERSEVERE  │

## Decision 1: Persevere

**The decision to continue testing an idea based on evidence and insights.**

### When to Persevere

You persevere by:
- Further testing the **same hypothesis** with a **stronger experiment**
- Moving on to your **next important hypothesis**

### Persevere Signals

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Evidence supports hypothesis | Test next critical hypothesis |
| Need stronger evidence | Same hypothesis, higher fidelity experiment |
| Confidence level not high enough | Run additional experiments |

### Example Persevere Actions

- "We will run a landing page test to validate the interest we saw in interviews"
- "We will move to testing our pricing hypothesis now that we've validated demand"
- "We will conduct a concierge test to get stronger evidence of willingness to pay"

---

## Decision 2: Pivot

**The decision to make a significant change to one or more elements of your ideas, value proposition, or business model.**

### What a Pivot Means

A pivot often means that:
- Some of your earlier evidence may be **irrelevant** to your new trajectory
- It usually requires **retesting elements** of your business model that you've already tested
- You're not starting from zero, but you're changing direction significantly

### Types of Pivots

| Pivot Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Customer Segment** | Change who you're targeting | B2C → B2B |
| **Value Proposition** | Change what value you deliver | Feature focus → Outcome focus |
| **Channel** | Change how you reach customers | Direct sales → Self-service |
| **Revenue Model** | Change how you make money | Subscription → Transaction fee |
| **Problem** | Change which problem you solve | Same customer, different pain |

### Pivot Signals

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Evidence refutes hypothesis | Consider pivot or kill |
| New insight discovered | May require pivot to capture opportunity |
| Market feedback contradicts assumptions | Pivot to align with reality |

### Example Pivot Actions

- "We will pivot from targeting individual consumers to small businesses"
- "We will change our revenue model from subscription to commission-based"
- "We will pivot to focus on the kindergarten segment based on search data"

---

## Decision 3: Kill

**The decision to kill an idea based on evidence and insights.**

### When to Kill

The evidence might show that:
- An idea **won't work in reality**
- The **profit potential is insufficient**
- The market is **too small**
- You **can't reach customers** cost-effectively
- The problem **isn't painful enough**

### Kill Signals

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Strong evidence refutes core hypothesis | Kill the idea |
| Multiple pivots haven't improved results | Kill the idea |
| Unit economics don't work | Kill the idea |
| No path to profitability | Kill the idea |

### Why Killing is Valuable

- **Frees up resources** for better opportunities
- **Faster learning** by not prolonging failure
- **Evidence-based** decision, not emotional
- **Better than slow death** of a zombie project

### Example Kill Actions

- "We will kill this idea because the market is too small to support our growth targets"
- "We will abandon this approach because customers won't pay enough to cover our costs"
- "We will stop testing because the core value proposition was refuted by multiple experiments"

## The Innovation Loop

The decide step sits at the center of the innovation loop, connecting testing and business design.

                    TEST
```

### Loop Pathways

| Outcome | Next Step |
|---------|-----------|
| **Evidence Refutes Hypothesis** | Kill or Pivot → Return to Business Design |
| **Evidence Supports Hypothesis** | Persevere → Test next hypothesis OR same hypothesis with higher fidelity |
| **New Insight Discovered** | Kill, Pivot, or Persevere → Depends on insight |
| **Unclear Insight** | Continue testing → Need more evidence |

---

## Decision Framework by Evidence Outcome

### When Evidence REFUTES Hypothesis

| Option | When to Choose |
|--------|----------------|
| **Kill** | Core assumption is wrong, no viable path forward |
| **Pivot** | The insight reveals a better direction |

### When Evidence SUPPORTS Hypothesis

| Option | When to Choose |
|--------|----------------|
| **Test next critical hypothesis** | Current hypothesis validated with sufficient confidence |
| **Same hypothesis, higher fidelity experiment** | Need stronger evidence before moving on |

### When Evidence is UNCLEAR

| Option | When to Choose |
|--------|----------------|
| **Continue testing** | Need more data points or different experiment types |

### When NEW INSIGHT is Discovered

| Option | When to Choose |
|--------|----------------|
| **Kill** | New insight shows fundamental flaw |
| **Pivot** | New insight reveals better opportunity |
| **Persevere** | New insight refines but doesn't change direction |

## Making Good Decisions

### Decision Quality Checklist

Before making a decision, verify:

- [ ] Have we gathered sufficient evidence?
- [ ] Is the evidence strong enough (not just opinions)?
- [ ] Have we tested with multiple experiment types?
- [ ] Are we being objective, not emotional?
- [ ] Have we considered all three options?
- [ ] Is the decision based on insights, not hopes?

### Common Decision Traps

| Trap | Description | Antidote |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Sunk Cost Fallacy** | "We've invested too much to quit" | Judge based on future potential, not past investment |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Only seeing evidence that supports your belief | Actively seek disconfirming evidence |
| **Premature Scaling** | Moving forward without sufficient validation | Require strong evidence before major investment |
| **Zombie Projects** | Neither killing nor pivoting, just lingering | Set clear kill criteria upfront |
| **Pivoting Too Fast** | Changing direction before gathering enough data | Run sufficient experiments before pivoting |

### Decision Meeting Structure

1. **Review the hypothesis** that was tested
2. **Present the evidence** collected
3. **Share the insights** derived
4. **Discuss the options** (Persevere, Pivot, Kill)
5. **Make the decision** as a team
6. **Document next actions** on the Learning Card

---

## Documenting Decisions

Use the Learning Card's "Therefore, we will..." section to document decisions:

### Persevere Examples

- "Therefore, we will run a landing page experiment to get stronger evidence"
- "Therefore, we will test our pricing hypothesis with a pre-sale campaign"
- "Therefore, we will conduct 20 more interviews with the kindergarten segment"

### Pivot Examples

- "Therefore, we will pivot to target small business owners instead of consumers"
- "Therefore, we will change our value proposition to emphasize uniqueness"
- "Therefore, we will explore a B2B model given the consumer price sensitivity"

### Kill Examples

- "Therefore, we will kill this idea and move to our next opportunity"
- "Therefore, we will abandon this customer segment and explore alternatives"
- "Therefore, we will stop development and reallocate resources"

## Quick Reference

### Decision Matrix

| Evidence Outcome | Confidence Level | Recommended Action |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Supports | High | Persevere → Next hypothesis |
| Supports | Medium | Persevere → Stronger experiment |
| Supports | Low | Continue testing |
| Refutes | High | Kill or Pivot |
| Refutes | Medium | Consider pivot, test alternative |
| Refutes | Low | Continue testing |
| Unclear | Any | Continue testing |

### Key Questions for Each Decision

**Before Persevering:**
- Do we have enough evidence to move forward?
- Should we run a stronger experiment first?
- What's the next most critical hypothesis?

**Before Pivoting:**
- What new direction does the evidence suggest?
- What elements of our business model need to change?
- What previous evidence is still valid?

**Before Killing:**
- Have we tested enough to be confident?
- Is there any pivot that could save the idea?
- What did we learn that we can apply elsewhere?
