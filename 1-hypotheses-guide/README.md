## What is a Hypothesis?

A hypothesis is an educated guess — an instrument used to prove or refute assumptions.

**Business Hypothesis Definition:**
- An assumption that your value proposition, business model, or strategy builds on
- What you need to learn about to understand if your business idea might work

**Format:** Always begin with **"We believe that..."**

```
"We believe that millennial parents will subscribe to monthly
educational science projects for their kids."
```

### Avoiding Confirmation Bias

When creating hypotheses in the "We believe that..." format, you risk falling into a confirmation bias trap — constantly trying to prove what you believe instead of trying to refute it.

**Solution:** Create competing hypotheses that try to disprove your assumptions:

| Hypothesis | Competing Hypothesis |
|------------|---------------------|
| "We believe that millennial parents **will** subscribe..." | "We believe that millennial parents **won't** subscribe..." |

You can test competing hypotheses simultaneously. This is especially helpful when team members disagree on which hypothesis to test.

## Three Types of Hypotheses

Every business idea must answer three fundamental questions:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │                     │
            ┌───────┤     FEASIBLE        ├───────┐
            │       │   "Can we do this?" │       │
            │       └─────────────────────┘       │
            │                                     │
            │                                     │
┌───────────▼───────────┐           ┌─────────────▼───────────┐
│                       │           │                         │
│        VIABLE         │           │       DESIRABLE         │
│  "Should we do this?" │           │  "Do they want this?"   │
│                       │           │                         │
└───────────────────────┘           └─────────────────────────┘
```

### Order of Exploration

| Priority | Type | Question | Risk Type |
|----------|------|----------|-----------|
| 1st | **Desirability** | Do they want this? | Market Risk |
| 2nd | **Feasibility** | Can we do this? | Infrastructure Risk |
| 3rd | **Viability** | Should we do this? | Financial Risk |

📷 *See: `png/types-of-hypotheses.png`*

---

### 1. Desirability Hypotheses (Market Risk)

**Question:** "Do they want this?"

**Risk:** The market is too small, too few customers want the value proposition, or the company can't reach, acquire, and retain targeted customers.

⚠️ **Explore First** — These are the most critical hypotheses to test early.

#### Sources from Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)

| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Customer Profile** | We believe we are addressing jobs that really matter to customers |
| | We believe we are focused on pains that really matter to customers |
| | We believe we are focused on gains that really matter to customers |
| **Value Map** | We believe our products and services really solve high-value customer jobs |
| | We believe our products and services relieve top customer pains |
| | We believe our products and services create important customer gains |

#### Sources from Business Model Canvas (BMC)

| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Customer Segments** | We believe we are targeting the right customer segments |
| | We believe the segments we are targeting actually exist |
| | We believe the segments we are targeting are big enough |
| **Value Propositions** | We believe we have the right value propositions for our customers |
| | We believe our value proposition is unique enough to replicate |
| **Channels** | We believe we have the right channels to reach and acquire customers |
| | We believe we can master the channels to deliver value |
| **Customer Relationships** | We believe we can build the right relationships with customers |
| | We believe it is difficult for customers to switch to competitors |
| | We believe we can retain customers |

### 2. Feasibility Hypotheses (Infrastructure Risk)

**Question:** "Can we do this?"

**Risk:** The business can't manage, scale, or get access to key resources (technology, IP, brand, etc.), key activities, or key partners.

⚠️ **Explore Second** — After validating desirability.

#### Sources from Business Model Canvas (BMC)

| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Key Activities** | We believe we can perform all activities (at scale) and at the right quality level required to build our business model |
| **Key Resources** | We believe we can secure and manage all technologies and resources (at scale), including IP, human, financial, and other resources |
| **Key Partners** | We believe we can create the partnerships required to build our business |

📷 *See: `png/feasibility & viability hypotheses.png`*

---

### 3. Viability Hypotheses (Financial Risk)

**Question:** "Should we do this?"

**Risk:** The business cannot generate more revenue than costs.

⚠️ **Explore Third** — After validating desirability and feasibility.

#### Sources from Business Model Canvas (BMC)

| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Revenue Streams** | We believe we can get customers to pay a specific price for our value propositions |
| | We believe we can generate sufficient revenues |
| **Cost Structure** | We believe we can manage costs from our infrastructure and keep them under control |
| **Profit** | We believe we can generate more revenues than costs in order to make a profit |

## Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis

A well-formed business hypothesis must be **Testable**, **Precise**, and **Discrete**.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     GOOD HYPOTHESIS                             │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
│    TESTABLE     │      PRECISE        │       DISCRETE          │
│                 │                     │                         │
│  Can be shown   │  Describes the      │  Describes only ONE     │
│  TRUE or FALSE  │  what, who, when    │  distinct thing         │
│  with evidence  │  of assumptions     │  to investigate         │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Testable

Your hypothesis can be shown true (validated) or false (invalidated), based on evidence.

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "We believe millennial parents prefer craft projects." | "We believe millennial parents prefer curated science projects that match their kids' education level." |

### 2. Precise

Your hypothesis describes the precise **what**, **who**, and **when** of your assumptions.

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "We believe millennials will spend a lot on science projects." | "We believe millennial parents with kids ages 5–9 will pay $15 a month for curated science projects that match their kids' education level." |

### 3. Discrete

Your hypothesis describes only **one distinct**, testable, and precise thing.

| ❌ Bad (Multiple Things) | ✅ Good (Split Into Two) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| "We believe we can buy and ship science project boxes at a profit." | "We believe we can purchase science project materials at wholesale for less than $3 a box." |
| | "We believe we can ship science project materials domestically for less than $5 a box." |

## The Two-Step Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      TWO-STEP PROCESS                           │
├────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┤
│         STEP 1             │            STEP 2                  │

│                            │                                    │
│  Make explicit all risks   │  Use the Assumptions Map to        │
│  that your idea won't      │  prioritize by importance and      │
│  work. Turn assumptions    │  existence of evidence.            │
│  into clear hypotheses.    │                                    │
└────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
```

📷 *See: `png/two-steps-process.png`*

### Step 1: Identify Hypotheses

Make explicit all the risks that your idea won't work. Turn assumptions into clear hypotheses.

**Best Practices:**
- Use different color sticky notes for desirability, feasibility, and viability
- Be as specific as possible based on what you know today
- One hypothesis per sticky note (no bullet points — makes prioritization easier)
- Keep hypotheses short and precise — no "blah blah blah"
- Discuss and agree as a team when writing

**Process:**
1. Write down each **desirability** hypothesis → put on canvases
2. Write down each **feasibility** hypothesis → put on canvases
3. Write down each **viability** hypothesis → put on canvases

📷 *See: `png/assumption-mapping-step1.png`*

### Step 2: Prioritize Hypotheses

Use the Assumptions Map to prioritize all hypotheses based on **importance** and **evidence**.

## The Assumptions Map

A 2x2 matrix for prioritizing hypotheses based on **Importance** (Y-axis) and **Evidence** (X-axis).

```
                         IMPORTANT
                             │

### Axis Definitions

#### X-Axis: Evidence

| Position | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Left** | You have relevant, observable, and recent evidence to support the hypothesis |
| **Right** | You do not have evidence and need to generate it |

#### Y-Axis: Importance

| Position | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Top** | Absolutely critical — if proven wrong, your business idea will fail |
| **Bottom** | Not one of the first things you'd go out and test |

### Quadrant Actions

| Quadrant | Position | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **EXPERIMENT** | Top Right (Important + No Evidence) | 🎯 **TEST FIRST** — Focus experiments here. These define your near-term experimentation. |
| **SHARE** | Top Left (Important + Have Evidence) | 📢 Challenge the evidence. Does it really have observable data? Track in your plan. |
| **DEFER** | Bottom Right (Unimportant + No Evidence) | ⏸️ Address later when resources allow. |
| **MONITOR** | Bottom Left (Unimportant + Have Evidence) | 👁️ Keep on radar but don't prioritize. |

### Step-by-Step Prioritization

1. **Prioritize Desirability Hypotheses First** — Pull each desirability hypothesis onto the map
2. **Prioritize Feasibility Hypotheses Second** — Add feasibility hypotheses to the map
3. **Prioritize Viability Hypotheses Third** — Add viability hypotheses to the map
4. **Focus on Top Right** — These assumptions, if proven false, will cause your business to fail

### Key Questions for Prioritization

1. **"What is the most important hypothesis that needs to be true for my idea to work?"**
2. **"For which hypotheses do I lack concrete evidence from the field?"**

## Facilitation Guide

### Core Team

The core team consists of individuals dedicated to making this new business endeavor a success. They are cross-functional — having product, design, and technology skills needed to ship and learn rapidly.

**Requirements:**
- At minimum, present when mapping assumptions from Business Model Canvas
- Cross-functional skills (product, design, technology)
- Dedicated to the venture's success

### Supporting Team

The supporting team consists of individuals who are not necessarily dedicated to the venture but are needed for success. People from legal, safety, compliance, marketing, and user research will be required for testing where the core team lacks domain knowledge.

**Without a strong supporting team:**
- Core members may lack evidence
- Uninformed decisions about importance
- Blind spots in compliance and regulations

### Team Collaboration Tips

| Activity | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Writing Hypotheses | Discuss and agree as a team |
| Prioritization | Use voting or dot-voting for ranking |
| Evidence Gathering | Assign owners to hypotheses |
| Testing | Pair core + supporting team members |

## Quick Reference

### Hypothesis Writing Checklist

- [ ] Starts with "We believe that..."
- [ ] Is **testable** (can be proven true or false)
- [ ] Is **precise** (specific what, who, when)
- [ ] Is **discrete** (one thing per hypothesis)
- [ ] Is short and concise (fits on a sticky note)
- [ ] Has a clear success metric

### Prioritization Questions

- [ ] Is this hypothesis critical to business success?
- [ ] Do we have evidence to support or refute this?
- [ ] Should this be tested now or later?
- [ ] What experiment would validate this?

### Assumptions Map Quick Reference

| Quadrant | Condition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **EXPERIMENT** | Important + No Evidence | Test immediately |
| **SHARE** | Important + Have Evidence | Validate and share |
| **DEFER** | Unimportant + No Evidence | Address later |
| **MONITOR** | Unimportant + Have Evidence | Keep on radar |

### Hypothesis Type Priority

```
1st → DESIRABILITY (Market Risk)      → "Do they want this?"
2nd → FEASIBILITY (Infrastructure)    → "Can we do this?"
3rd → VIABILITY (Financial Risk)      → "Should we do this?"
```

## Next Steps: From Hypotheses to Experiments

After prioritizing hypotheses using the Assumptions Map:

1. Take hypotheses from the **EXPERIMENT** quadrant (Important + No Evidence)
2. Design experiments using Test Cards (see `../2-experiment-guide/`)
3. Run experiments and collect evidence
4. Update hypothesis positions on the map based on learnings
5. Iterate until you have confidence to pivot, persevere, or kill
