## What is a Hypothesis?

A hypothesis is an educated guess — an instrument used to prove or refute assumptions.

**Business Hypothesis Definition:**
- An assumption that your value proposition, business model, or strategy builds on
- What you need to learn about to understand if your business idea might work

**Format:** Begin with the phrase "We believe that..."

> *"We believe that millennial parents will subscribe to monthly educational science projects for their kids."*

### Avoiding Confirmation Bias

When creating hypotheses in the "We believe that..." format, you risk falling into a confirmation bias trap — constantly trying to prove what you believe instead of trying to refute it.

**Solution:** Create competing hypotheses that try to disprove your assumptions:
- "We believe that millennial parents **won't** subscribe to monthly educational science projects for their kids."

You can test competing hypotheses simultaneously. This is especially helpful when team members disagree on which hypothesis to test.

## Three Types of Hypotheses

Every business idea must answer three fundamental questions:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │                     │
            ┌───────┤     FEASIBLE        ├───────┐
            │       │   "Can we do this?" │       │
            │       └─────────────────────┘       │
            │                                     │
            │                                     │
┌───────────▼───────────┐           ┌─────────────▼───────────┐
│                       │           │                         │
│        VIABLE         │           │       DESIRABLE         │
│  "Should we do this?" │           │  "Do they want this?"   │
│                       │           │                         │
└───────────────────────┘           └─────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Desirability Hypotheses (Market Risk)

**Question:** "Do they want this?"

**Risk:** The market is too small, too few customers want the value proposition, or the company can't reach, acquire, and retain targeted customers.

**Explore First** — These are the most critical hypotheses to test early.

**Sources in VPC:**
| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Customer Profile** | We believe we are addressing jobs that really matter to customers |
| | We believe we are focused on pains that really matter to customers |
| | We believe we are focused on gains that really matter to customers |
| **Value Map** | We believe our products and services really solve high-value customer jobs |
| | We believe our products and services relieve top customer pains |
| | We believe our products and services create important customer gains |

**Sources in BMC:**
| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Customer Segments** | We believe we are targeting the right customer segments |
| | We believe the segments we are targeting actually exist |
| | We believe the segments we are targeting are big enough |
| **Value Propositions** | We believe we have the right value propositions for the customer segments we are targeting |
| | We believe our value proposition is unique enough to replicate |
| **Channels** | We believe we have the right channels to reach and acquire our customers |
| | We believe we can master the channels to deliver value |
| **Customer Relationships** | We believe we can build the right relationships with customers |
| | We believe it is difficult for customers to switch to a competitor's product |
| | We believe we can retain customers |

---

### 2. Feasibility Hypotheses (Infrastructure Risk)

**Question:** "Can we do this?"

**Risk:** The business can't manage, scale, or get access to key resources (technology, IP, brand, etc.), key activities, or key partners.

**Explore Second** — After validating desirability.

**Sources in BMC:**
| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Key Activities** | We believe we can perform all activities (at scale) and at the right quality level that is required to build our business model |
| **Key Resources** | We believe we can secure and manage all technologies and resources (at scale) that are required to build our business model, including intellectual property and human, financial, and other resources |
| **Key Partners** | We believe we can create the partnerships required to build our business |

---

### 3. Viability Hypotheses (Financial Risk)

**Question:** "Should we do this?"

**Risk:** The business cannot generate more revenue than costs (revenue stream and cost structure).

**Explore Third** — After validating desirability and feasibility.

**Sources in BMC:**
| Component | Example Hypotheses |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Revenue Streams** | We believe we can get customers to pay a specific price for our value propositions |
| | We believe we can generate sufficient revenues |
| **Cost Structure** | We believe we can manage costs from our infrastructure and keep them under control |
| **Profit** | We believe we can generate more revenues than costs in order to make a profit |

## Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis

A well-formed business hypothesis must be **Testable**, **Precise**, and **Discrete**.

### 1. Testable

Your hypothesis is testable when it can be shown true (validated) or false (invalidated), based on evidence.

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "We believe millennial parents prefer craft projects." | "We believe millennial parents prefer curated science projects that match their kids' education level." |

### 2. Precise

Your hypothesis is precise when you know what success looks like. It describes the precise **what**, **who**, and **when** of your assumptions.

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "We believe millennials will spend a lot on science projects." | "We believe millennial parents with kids ages 5–9 will pay $15 a month for curated science projects that match their kids' education level." |

### 3. Discrete

Your hypothesis is discrete when it describes only one distinct, testable, and precise thing you want to investigate.

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "We believe we can buy and ship science project boxes at a profit." | "We believe we can purchase science project materials at wholesale for less than $3 a box." |
| | "We believe we can ship science project materials domestically for less than $5 a box." |

## The Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Hypotheses

Make explicit all the risks that your idea won't work. Turn the assumptions underlying your idea into clear hypotheses that you can test.

**Best Practices:**
- Use different color sticky notes for desirability, feasibility, and viability hypotheses
- Your hypotheses should be as specific as possible, based on what you know today
- Every hypothesis should be a single sticky note — don't use bullet points (makes prioritization easier)
- Keep your hypotheses short and precise — no "blah blah blah"
- Discuss and agree as a team when writing

**Process:**
1. Use a sticky note to write down each desirability hypothesis and put it on your canvases
2. Use a sticky note to write down each feasibility hypothesis and put it on your canvases
3. Use a sticky note to write down each viability hypothesis and put it on your canvases

### Step 2: Prioritize Hypotheses

Use the Assumptions Map to prioritize all your hypotheses in terms of importance and existence (or absence) of evidence.

    │   → Lower priority     │   → Lowest priority    │

    │                        │                        │

                        UNIMPORTANT
```

### X-Axis: Evidence

Position hypotheses based on how much evidence you have to support or refute them:
- **Left:** You have relevant, observable, and recent evidence to support the hypothesis
- **Right:** You do not have evidence and need to generate it

### Y-Axis: Importance

Position hypotheses based on how critical they are to business success:
- **Top:** Absolutely critical — if proven wrong, your business idea will fail and all other hypotheses become irrelevant
- **Bottom:** Not one of the first things you'd go out and test

### Quadrant Actions

| Quadrant | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Top Right** (Important + No Evidence) | **TEST FIRST** — Focus experiments here. These high-risk themes define your near-term experimentation. |
| **Top Left** (Important + Have Evidence) | **SHARE** — Challenge the evidence. Do these hypotheses really have observable evidence to back them up? Track in your plan. |
| **Bottom Right** (Unimportant + No Evidence) | **DEFER** — Address later when resources allow. |
| **Bottom Left** (Unimportant + Have Evidence) | **MONITOR** — Keep on radar but don't prioritize. |

## Step-by-Step Prioritization Process

### 1. Prioritize Desirability Hypotheses First

As a team, pull over each desirability hypothesis and place it on the Assumptions Map.

### 2. Prioritize Feasibility Hypotheses Second

Next, pull over each feasibility hypothesis and place it on the Assumptions Map.

### 3. Prioritize Viability Hypotheses Third

Then pull over each viability hypothesis and place it on the Assumptions Map.

### 4. Focus on Top Right

The major focus is on how to test the **top right quadrant** of your Assumptions Map: experiments with important hypotheses and little evidence.

> These assumptions, if proven false, will cause your business to fail.

---

## Key Questions for Prioritization

When prioritizing hypotheses, ask:

1. **"What is the most important hypothesis that needs to be true for my idea to work?"**
2. **"For which hypotheses do I lack concrete evidence from the field?"**

---

## Facilitation Notes

### Core Team

The core team consists of individuals dedicated to making this new business endeavor a success. They are cross-functional — having product, design, and technology skills needed to ship and learn rapidly in the market with real customers.

At a minimum, the core team needs to be present when mapping out the assumptions from your Business Model Canvas.

### Supporting Team

The supporting team consists of individuals who are not necessarily dedicated to the business endeavor but who are needed for it to be a success. People from legal, safety, compliance, marketing, and user research will be required for testing assumptions where the core team lacks domain knowledge and know-how.

Without a strong supporting team, core members may lack evidence and make uninformed decisions about what's important.
