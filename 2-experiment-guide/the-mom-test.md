# The Mom Test

A framework for talking to customers without getting lied to, based on Rob Fitzpatrick's book "The Mom Test."

## Why "The Mom Test"?

The name comes from a simple idea: **your mom will lie to you**. Not maliciously—she loves you and wants to protect your feelings. When you ask "Mom, do you think this is a good idea?", she'll say yes because she cares about you, not because it's actually a good idea.

The problem is, almost everyone does this. Customers, friends, colleagues—they'll tell you what you want to hear to avoid hurting your feelings or appearing negative. This leads to **false validation** that can waste months of effort building something nobody actually wants.

**The Mom Test provides questions that even your mom can't lie to you about.**

## The 3 Rules of The Mom Test

### Rule 1: Talk About Their Life, Not Your Idea

| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Do Ask |
|-------------|----------|
| "I'm building an app that does X..." | "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]" |
| "Would you use a product that...?" | "How do you currently handle [situation]?" |
| "What do you think of this idea?" | "What's the hardest part about [activity]?" |

**Why:** The moment you mention your idea, you've contaminated the conversation. People will start reacting to your pitch instead of sharing their actual problems. If you never mention your idea, you're forced to ask about their life—which is what you actually need to learn about.

### Rule 2: Ask About Specifics in the Past, Not Hypotheticals About the Future

| ❌ Don't Ask | ✅ Do Ask |
|-------------|----------|
| "Would you ever...?" | "When did you last...?" |
| "Do you usually...?" | "Tell me about the last time..." |
| "How much would you pay for...?" | "How much have you spent trying to solve this?" |
| "Would this be useful?" | "What have you tried? How did it go?" |

**Why:** People are terrible at predicting their own future behavior. They're optimistic, they want to be helpful, and they genuinely believe they'll act differently tomorrow. But their past behavior is fact—it's the best predictor of what they'll actually do.

### Rule 3: Talk Less and Listen More

**The 80/20 Rule:** You should be listening at least 80% of the time.

- If you're doing most of the talking, you're pitching, not learning
- Awkward silences are your friend—people will fill them with valuable information
- Don't interrupt, even when you're excited to share something
- Take notes on their exact words, not your interpretation

## The 3 Types of Bad Data

Every customer conversation produces data. But not all data is useful. Watch out for these dangerous signals that feel like validation but aren't:

### 1. Compliments

> "That's a really cool idea!"
> "I love it!"
> "Yeah, that sounds useful."

**Why it's bad:** Compliments contain zero information. They're social lubricant, not product feedback. People give compliments to be nice, not because they'll buy.

**How to deflect:**
- "Thanks! But help me understand—what specifically would this help you accomplish?"
- "I appreciate that. Can you tell me about the last time you faced this problem?"
- Don't fish for compliments, and don't linger on them when you get them.

### 2. Fluff (Hypotheticals, Generics, Future Promises)

> "I would definitely use that."
> "I always struggle with this."
> "I could see myself paying for that."

**Fluff keywords to watch for:**
- "I would..." / "I will..." (future promises)
- "I usually..." / "I always..." / "I never..." (generics)
- "I might..." / "I could..." (hypothetical maybes)

**How to anchor to reality:**
- "You mentioned you always do X. When was the last time you did it?"
- "Walk me through what happened the most recent time..."
- "You said you'd pay for this—have you looked for a solution before? What did you try?"

### 3. Ideas and Feature Requests

> "You should add a feature that does X!"
> "It would be better if it had..."
> "What you really need is..."

**Why it's bad:** Customers are not product designers. They'll tell you surface-level solutions without understanding the deeper problem. Ideas are easy to give; understanding the underlying motivation is hard.

**How to dig deeper:**
- "Interesting—why would that help you?"
- "What would having that let you do?"
- "Is there a reason you haven't solved this yourself already?"

---

## Good Questions to Ask

These questions pass The Mom Test because they focus on facts, past behavior, and real consequences:

### Understanding the Problem

- **"What's the hardest part about [doing this thing]?"**
  - Open-ended, focused on their life, gets to real pain

- **"Tell me about the last time that happened..."**
  - Anchors to specific, real events instead of hypotheticals

- **"Why was that hard?"**
  - Digs for underlying motivations

- **"What, if anything, have you done to try to solve this?"**
  - If they haven't tried to solve it, they probably don't care enough to pay

- **"What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?"**
  - Reveals gaps in existing solutions

### Understanding Importance

- **"What are the implications of not solving this?"**
  - Separates "nice to have" from "must have"

- **"Where does this rank among your priorities?"**
  - Forces them to compare against other problems

- **"How much time/money are you currently spending on this?"**
  - Past spending is the best indicator of future spending

### Understanding Buying Behavior

- **"Who else is involved in this decision?"**
  - Reveals the real buying process

- **"What would need to be true for you to commit to [next step]?"**
  - Surfaces hidden objections

- **"Why hasn't this been solved already?"**
  - Uncovers market dynamics and constraints

## Bad Questions to Avoid

These questions will get you false validation:

| Bad Question | Why It's Bad |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Do you think it's a good idea?" | Invites opinion instead of facts |
| "Would you buy a product that did X?" | Future hypothetical, not past behavior |
| "How much would you pay for this?" | Meaningless without context of past spending |
| "What features would make you buy?" | Makes them a product designer |
| "Do you have this problem?" | Leading question, invites "yes" |
| "Wouldn't it be nice if...?" | Leading and hypothetical |

---

## Seeking Commitment, Not Compliments

A successful meeting ends with **commitment**, not **compliments**.

**Compliments are free. Commitment costs something.**

### Currencies of Commitment

Commitment comes in three forms, in increasing order of strength:

#### 1. Time Commitment (Weakest)

> Willingness to invest their time in your solution

- ✅ Agreeing to a longer follow-up meeting
- ✅ Agreeing to a trial period with regular check-ins
- ✅ Introducing you to their team for feedback
- ❌ Just saying "keep me updated"

#### 2. Reputation Commitment (Stronger)

> Willingness to stake their professional reputation

- ✅ Introducing you to their boss or decision-maker
- ✅ Agreeing to give a testimonial
- ✅ Connecting you with peers in the industry
- ✅ Allowing you to use their name as a reference
- ❌ Vague "I know some people who might be interested"

#### 3. Financial Commitment (Strongest)

> Willingness to pay money

- ✅ Pre-order or deposit
- ✅ Letter of intent
- ✅ Signing a pilot contract
- ❌ "I would pay..." (hypothetical, not commitment)

### Commitment Examples by Stage

| Stage | Good Commitment | Bad Sign |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Problem Discovery | "Let me introduce you to my colleague who handles this" | "Sounds interesting, keep me posted" |
| Solution Validation | "Can I try an early version next week?" | "Let me know when it's ready" |
| Pricing Validation | "Here's a deposit for the beta" | "I'd definitely pay for that" |

### The Meeting Success Rule

**If you don't know what happens next after a meeting, the meeting was pointless.**

Always end with a clear next step:
- "Based on what we discussed, would you be willing to [specific commitment]?"
- "What would you need to see to [take next step]?"
- If they won't commit, that's valuable data—ask why

## Warning Signs in Conversations

### Signs You're Getting Bad Data

| Warning Sign | What to Do |
|--------------|------------|
| They keep saying how great your idea is | Deflect compliments, dig for specifics |
| They're agreeing with everything | Play devil's advocate, ask about concerns |
| You're doing most of the talking | Stop, ask an open question, wait |
| They're describing a utopian future | Anchor back to past behavior |
| They're giving you feature ideas | Ask why, dig for underlying motivation |
| They say "I would..." or "I will..." | Ask about past behavior instead |

### Signs You're Getting Good Data

| Good Sign | Why It's Good |
|-----------|---------------|
| They tell you about problems you didn't ask about | Shows genuine pain |
| They describe failed attempts to solve the problem | Proves they care enough to act |
| They offer introductions without being asked | Reputation commitment |
| They ask about pricing or availability | Shows buying intent |
| They tell you what's wrong with your idea | Honest feedback is gold |
| They share specific numbers (time spent, money wasted) | Concrete, actionable data |

## Conversation Flow Example

### ❌ Bad Conversation (Fishing for Compliments)

> **Founder:** "I'm building an app that helps people manage their receipts. Do you think that's a good idea?"
>
> **Customer:** "Yeah, I hate dealing with receipts. That sounds useful!"
>
> **Founder:** "Would you use something like that?"
>
> **Customer:** "Definitely! I'd totally use that."
>
> **Founder:** "Awesome, thanks!"

**Result:** Zero useful data. The customer was being polite.

### ✅ Good Conversation (The Mom Test)

> **Founder:** "Tell me about the last time you dealt with expense reports."
>
> **Customer:** "Ugh, last month I spent two hours digging through my wallet for receipts."
>
> **Founder:** "Two hours! What made it take so long?"
>
> **Customer:** "I'd lost half of them. Had to pull up credit card statements and match them."
>
> **Founder:** "Have you tried any apps or systems to deal with this?"
>
> **Customer:** "I tried Expensify once but stopped after a week."
>
> **Founder:** "Why'd you stop?"
>
> **Customer:** "The scanning was flaky and I forgot to use it."
>
> **Founder:** "What would make you actually stick with something like that?"
>
> **Customer:** "Honestly? If it just automatically captured everything without me thinking about it."

**Result:** Real data about past behavior, failed solutions, and actual needs.

| "I would definitely use that" | "When was the last time you tried to solve this?" |
| "I usually have this problem" | "Tell me about the most recent time" |
| "That's a great idea!" | "Thanks—what specifically would it help you do?" |
| "I could see paying for that" | "How much have you spent on this problem before?" |
| "You should add X feature" | "What would having that let you accomplish?" |

## Integration with OS Research Engine

### When to Apply The Mom Test

The Mom Test applies whenever you're:

1. **Conducting customer interviews** (Experiment #06)
2. **Running discovery surveys** (Experiment #05)
3. **Doing "A Day in the Life" observation** (Experiment #08)
4. **Testing with concierge or Wizard of Oz** (Experiments #29, #30)
5. **Getting feedback on prototypes or landing pages**

### Connecting to Hypothesis Testing

Use The Mom Test to validate hypotheses about customer problems:

```
HYPOTHESIS: We believe that [segment] struggles with [pain]

THE MOM TEST APPROACH:
• Don't ask: "Do you have this problem?"
• Do ask: "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [situation]"
• Do ask: "What have you tried? How did it go?"
• Do ask: "What are the consequences of not solving this?"

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
• They describe specific past instances (not hypotheticals)
• They've already tried to solve it (shows real pain)
• They can quantify the impact (time/money lost)
```

### For AI Agents

When conducting customer research or designing interview scripts, AI agents should:

1. **Never ask opinion questions** — Frame all questions around past behavior
2. **Flag hypothetical responses** — If user data contains "would," "usually," "always," look for anchoring follow-ups
3. **Look for commitment signals** — Time, reputation, or money invested indicates real interest
4. **Be skeptical of enthusiasm** — Compliments without commitment are noise
5. **Prioritize facts over feelings** — Specific examples > general sentiments
