## What is an Experiment?

**Experiments are the means to reduce the risk and uncertainty of your business idea.**

The experiment is at the core of the scientific method. It can be traced back through history to everything from how vision works to measuring time. What has remained consistent over time is that the scientific method is a valuable method for generating insights.

Experimentation is about structured creativity — tap into that energy within yourself and with your teams.

### Business Experiments

For the purposes of testing business ideas, the focus is on business experiments, which:

- Are **procedures to reduce the risk and uncertainty** of a business idea
- **Produce weak or strong evidence** that supports or refutes a hypothesis
- Can be **fast/slow** and **cheap/expensive** to conduct

```

Instead of building internally for long periods in a customer-free zone, experiments help you incrementally reduce your risk over time. This allows you to build at the right time and at the right fidelity.

**Key Insight:** Start with cheap and fast experiments to learn quickly. Every experiment will reduce the risk that you'll spend time, energy, and money on ideas that won't work.

---

## The Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Experiment

To get started with testing your business idea, turn your most important hypotheses into experiments.

**Start from the Assumptions Map:**
- Take hypotheses from the **top right quadrant** (Important + No Evidence)
- These are your highest priority hypotheses to test

**Best Practice:** Start with cheap and fast experiments to learn quickly. Every experiment will reduce the risk that you'll spend time, energy, and money on ideas that won't work.

### Step 2: Run Experiment

Every experiment has a specific run time to generate sufficient evidence that you can learn from.

**Run experiments like a scientist:**
- Ensure your evidence is clean and not misleading
- Follow the test protocol precisely
- Document everything
- Don't change variables mid-experiment

## What is a Good Experiment?

A good experiment is precise enough so that team members can replicate it and generate usable and comparable data.

### Three Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Who** | Defines the "who" precisely (test subject) |
| **Where** | Defines the "where" precisely (test context) |
| **What** | Defines the "what" precisely (test elements) |

## The Test Card

A well-formed business experiment is made up of four components, captured in a Test Card:

### The Four Components

| Component | Description | Prompt |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Hypothesis** | The most critical hypothesis from the top right quadrant of your Assumptions Map | "We believe that..." |
| **2. Experiment** | The description of the experiment you will run to support or refute the hypothesis | "To verify that, we will..." |
| **3. Metrics** | The data you will measure as part of the experiment | "And measure..." |
| **4. Criteria** | The success criteria for your experiment metrics | "We are right if..." |

### Test Card Metadata

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Test Name** | Descriptive name for the experiment type |
| **Assigned to** | Person responsible for running the experiment |
| **Deadline** | When the experiment should be completed |
| **Duration** | How long the experiment will run |
| **Critical** | How critical is this hypothesis (1-3 scale) |
| **Test Cost** | How expensive is this experiment ($ scale) |
| **Data Reliability** | How reliable is the data from this method (1-3 scale) |
| **Time Required** | How much time does this experiment take (1-3 scale) |

---

## Create Multiple Experiments for Each Hypothesis

> We've yet to work with a team who created just one experiment, had a major breakthrough, and then went on to create a multibillion dollar business from it.

**In reality, it takes a series of experiments to generate the possibility of a successful business.**

Use Test Cards and the experiment library to create well-formed experiments to test your business hypotheses.

### Example: Testing the Same Hypothesis Three Ways

**Hypothesis:** "We believe that millennial parents prefer curated science projects that fit their kids' education level."

| Experiment | Method | Metric | Success Criteria |
|------------|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Customer Interviews** | Interview 20 millennial parents about their kids' science project needs | Top customer jobs, pains, and gains that are not being met with existing solutions | We are 80% accurate in our top jobs, pains, and gains ranking |
| **Search Trend Analysis** | Perform trend analyses on millennial parents searching online for kids' science project solutions | Domestic search volume | Search volume exceeds 10,000 searches a month domestically |
| **Concierge** | Manually curate science project kits for 20 children of millennial parents | Time to create, cost to create, cost to ship, and customer satisfaction | Customer satisfaction score is "partially satisfied" to "very satisfied" for 16 of the 20 parents |

---

## Call-to-Action Experiments

A specific type of experiment that prompts a test subject to perform an observable action. Used in an experiment in order to test one or more hypotheses.

**Examples:**
- Landing page sign-ups
- Pre-order buttons
- Email list subscriptions
- Waitlist registrations

**Why they work:** Actions speak louder than words. What people say they will do and what they actually do are often different.

---

## Experiment Selection Criteria

When choosing which experiment to run, consider:

### Cost vs. Evidence Trade-off

| Factor | Low | High |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Test Cost** | Cheap to run | Expensive to run |
| **Data Reliability** | Weak evidence | Strong evidence |
| **Time Required** | Fast results | Slow results |

### General Guidance

1. **Start cheap and fast** — Learn quickly with low-cost experiments
2. **Increase fidelity over time** — As you gain confidence, invest in higher-fidelity experiments
3. **Match experiment to hypothesis type** — Desirability, feasibility, and viability hypotheses may require different experiment types
4. **Run multiple experiments** — Don't rely on a single data point

---

## Common Experiment Types

### Discovery Experiments (Weak Evidence, Low Cost)

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Customer Interviews** | Talk to potential customers about their problems | Understanding jobs, pains, gains |
| **Online Research** | Analyze search trends, forums, reviews | Market sizing, problem validation |
| **Observation** | Watch how people currently solve the problem | Behavior patterns |

### Validation Experiments (Stronger Evidence, Medium Cost)

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Landing Page** | Create a page describing your solution | Measuring interest |
| **Concierge** | Manually deliver the service | Testing value proposition |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Fake automation with manual backend | Testing user experience |
| **Pre-sales** | Sell before building | Willingness to pay |

### Confirmation Experiments (Strong Evidence, Higher Cost)

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Prototype** | Build a functional version | Usability testing |
| **Pilot** | Run with limited real customers | Full experience testing |
| **A/B Test** | Compare two versions | Optimization |

## Writing Good Test Cards

### Step 1: Hypothesis

**Format:** "We believe that [specific, testable assumption]"

✅ Good: "We believe that millennial parents with kids ages 5-9 will pay $15/month for curated science projects"
❌ Bad: "We believe parents like science projects"

### Step 2: Test

**Format:** "To verify that, we will [specific action]"

✅ Good: "Interview 20 millennial parents about their kids' science project needs"
❌ Bad: "Talk to some parents"

### Step 3: Metric

**Format:** "And measure [specific, quantifiable data]"

✅ Good: "The top customer jobs, pains, and gains that are not being met"
❌ Bad: "How they feel about it"

### Step 4: Criteria

**Format:** "We are right if [specific threshold]"

✅ Good: "We are 80% accurate in our top jobs, pains, and gains ranking"
❌ Bad: "People seem interested"

## Quick Reference

### Test Card Template

```
HYPOTHESIS: We believe that [specific assumption about customer/market/business]

TEST: To verify that, we will [specific experiment action]

METRIC: And measure [specific quantifiable data point]

CRITERIA: We are right if [specific success threshold]
```

### Experiment Checklist

- [ ] Hypothesis is from top-right quadrant of Assumptions Map
- [ ] Experiment is specific enough to replicate
- [ ] Metrics are quantifiable
- [ ] Success criteria has a clear threshold
- [ ] Assigned owner and deadline set
- [ ] Cost and time estimated
- [ ] Multiple experiments planned for critical hypotheses

### Key Questions Before Running

1. Is this the most important hypothesis to test right now?
2. Is this the cheapest/fastest way to get reliable evidence?
3. What would make us confident enough to move forward?
4. What would make us pivot or kill the idea?
