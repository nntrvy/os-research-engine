# Social Listening Analysis

Diễn đàn thảo luận / Discussion Forums

## Purpose

Use discussion forums to discover unmet jobs, pains, and gains in a product or service.

**✅ Ideal for:** Finding unmet needs in your current product or a competitor's product

## Preparation

1. **Identify discussion forums** to analyze (internal and external)

2. **Define questions** you want to answer. Is there evidence that:
   - You are not solving for top customer jobs?
   - You are not addressing major customer pains?
   - You are not creating customer gains?
   - Customers are creating their own work-around solutions to address your product deficiencies?

## Execution

1. Search for phrases related to your questions on discussion forums
2. Take screenshots and export your results
3. Write notes about urgency and tone in forum threads

## Analysis

1. Update Value Proposition Canvas based on your results
2. Direct message forum posters to see if they can speak with you in more detail
3. If possible, run experiments with them to help narrow the gap

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

- Relatively cheap - you're analyzing online discussion forums for unmet needs
- If analyzing your own forum, it's cost-effective and analytics may be built into your software
- If analyzing competitor's or other community forums, you can use low-cost web scraping tools or do it manually (saves cost but takes more time)

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Short (define questions, identify forums) |
| Running | Short (longer without web scraping tools) |

We recommend automating it if possible to shorten experiment running time.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium to Strong** (3-4/5)

### Workaround Solutions - Strong Evidence
- Look for patterns of alternative solutions or product modifications to make it do what people need
- Similar to Steve Blank's "building a solution to solve the problem" - strong evidence if people are hacking their own methods to solve problems the product hasn't addressed

### Feature Requests - Weak Evidence
- Look for patterns of top three features requested on discussion forums
- Identify underlying pains and jobs these features might solve
- Feature requests are relatively weak evidence - you'll need more experiments around the underlying job or pain the proposed feature solves

## Skills Required

- Research / Data

You need the ability to:
- Identify discussion forums
- Collect data
- Analyze it

Understanding how to scrape data from online websites and knowing which questions you want to answer when reviewing the data is essential.

## Requirements

**Discussion Forum Data**

The most important requirement is having discussion forums to analyze for your questions. If you feel there are unmet needs in a competitor's product, go to community and support forums where their customers post.

If you have your own discussion forums, those are also a great data source.
