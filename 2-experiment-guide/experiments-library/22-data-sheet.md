# Data Sheet

Bảng dữ liệu

## Purpose

A printed or digital page with technical specifications of your value proposition.

**✅ Ideal for:** Distilling your specifications into a single page to validate with customers and key partners

## Preparation

1. **Define value proposition** and solution specifications
2. **Create your data sheet**
3. **Source customers, key partners** and schedule interviews

## Execution

1. **Show data sheet** to customers
2. **One team member** conducts the interview
3. **Another team member** takes notes on quotes, jobs, pains, gains, and body language
4. **Close the interview** by asking if you can contact them in the future about higher-fidelity solutions, or when the solution is ready to sell

## Analysis

1. Review notes with team
2. Update Value Proposition Canvas based on learnings
3. Use learnings to refine and inform higher-fidelity experiments

## Connections

- **Headline:** Use value proposition from Value Map
- **Product/Service info:** Include details from Value Map
- **Specifications:** Expand on product/service technical details and illustrate
- **Benefits:** Include top three gains from Value Map

## Cost

💰 **Very Low** (1/5)

- Very cheap for printed data sheets - just need word processor or office software to create a one-page document and print it
- For digital versions, need basic web software to attach specifications to your website or email

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Few hours to a day |
| Testing | ~15 minutes per interview |

Setup includes time to gather specifications and format correctly. You'll need to recruit customers and key partners if presenting the data sheet in person.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium** (3/5)

### Customer Feedback
- Quotes and reactions when viewing the data sheet
- Relatively weak evidence but generally useful for qualitative insights

### Partner Feedback
- Responses from key partners about feasibility and interest
- Useful for validating business model assumptions

## Skills Required

- Design / Research

Data sheets require basic design skills to effectively communicate value proposition and specifications.

You need to include value proposition info and solution specifications, as well as source customers and/or key partners for validation purposes.

## Requirements

- Technical specifications already defined
- Clear value proposition
- Customer or partner quotes to validate with

## Interview Questions for Data Sheet Testing

### For Customers
- Does this solve a problem you have?
- What specifications are most important to you?
- What's missing from this sheet?
- What would make you want to learn more?

### For Partners
- Is this something you could work with?
- What would you need to know before partnering?
- Are the specifications realistic?
- What concerns do you have?

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Keep it to one page
- Lead with value proposition, not specs
- Use visuals to illustrate key features
- Include contact information
- Test with real customers/partners

### ❌ Don't:
- Overwhelm with technical jargon
- Forget the "why" (benefits)
- Make claims you can't back up
- Skip the validation step
- Use low-quality images
