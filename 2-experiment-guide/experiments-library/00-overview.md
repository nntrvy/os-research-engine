## Tips for Best Use

1. Keep this guide open while working on your experiments
2. Use the structure to document your own test results
3. Come back regularly to compare across methods
4. Start with cheaper, faster experiments before investing in expensive ones
5. Combine multiple experiments for stronger evidence
6. **Apply The Mom Test** (`../the-mom-test.md`) to all customer conversations — avoid compliments, fluff, and hypotheticals
