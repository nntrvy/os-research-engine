Phân tích xu hướng tìm kiếm

## Purpose

Use search data to investigate specific interactions between online searchers, search engines, and content.

**✅ Ideal for:** Conducting your own market research, especially on new trends, rather than relying on third-party market research data

## Preparation

1. **Select tools:**
   - Google Trends
   - Google Keyword Planner
   - KeywordTool.io
   - Trends.vc
   - SemRush or Ahrefs (paid)

2. **Define geographic region** for your search

3. **List topics to explore**, such as:
   - People trying to solve customer jobs
   - Individuals needing to solve a customer pain
   - Those wanting to create a customer gain
   - Customers dissatisfied with existing solutions

## Execution

1. Search for phrases related to your topics
2. Take screenshots and export your results
3. Write notes during research about what surprises you

## Analysis

1. Collect your results
2. Consider **Problem Size vs Market Size**
   - What problem has the highest search volume?
   - Is this a meaningful business opportunity for you?
3. Choose 1-3 highest volume searches you want to explore in more detail in upcoming experiments

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

- Google Trends and Google Keyword Planner are free
- Cost increases with professional tools like SemRush or Ahrefs

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Few minutes to a few hours |
| Running | Few hours to a few days |

Depends largely on the number of topics and geographic locations you're exploring.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium** (3/5)

### Search Volume
- Number of keyword searches in a given time period
- Volume varies by geographic location, time, and industry
- Compare your results with others to get a general sense of interest level

### Related Queries
- Queries users searched for, beyond the query you entered
- If conducted properly, evidence strength of search volume and related queries can be stronger than smaller qualitative research methods

## Skills Required

- Marketing / Research / Data

Can be performed by most people willing to learn online trend analysis tools. Most tools (Google Trends, Google Keyword Planner) provide step-by-step contextual help. You still need the ability to interpret results.

## Requirements

**Online Customers**

Search trend analysis can be a powerful experiment for discovering customer jobs, pains, gains, and even their willingness to pay. However, customers must be searching online to generate this evidence.

If you're targeting a niche, B2B, or primarily offline customer market, your searches won't return any significant search volume.
