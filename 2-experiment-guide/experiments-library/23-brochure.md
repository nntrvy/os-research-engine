# Brochure

Tài liệu quảng cáo

## Purpose

A printed material simulation of your imaginary value proposition (offline).

**✅ Ideal for:** Validating your value proposition directly with customers who are hard to find online (e.g., rural areas)

## Preparation

1. **Design your brochure** using connections from Value Proposition Canvas
2. **Plan where** to find your customer segment

## Execution

1. **Show brochure** to customers
2. **One team member** conducts the interview
3. **Another team member** takes notes on quotes, jobs, pains, gains, and body language
4. **Count** how many people view the brochure and how many accept it
5. **Close the interview** by telling customers that if they want to learn more or purchase, contact you using the information on the brochure

## Analysis

1. Review notes with team
2. Update Value Proposition Canvas based on learnings
3. Track number of people who contact you from the brochure information
4. Use learnings to refine and inform higher-fidelity experiments

## Connections

- **Value Proposition:** From your Value Map
- **Solution:** From Value Map's Products and Services. Position next to value proposition so customers understand how you'll deliver value
- **Customer Pains:** From Customer Profile. Choose the three most-voted pains and include them inside the brochure

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

- Low cost for printed brochures if you can use a word processor and have basic design skills
- Cost increases if you decide to hire an external agency or professional designer

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | 1-2 days (with skills), 1-2 weeks (without) |
| Testing | ~15 minutes per interview |

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium** (3/5)

### Engagement Metrics
- **Views:** Number of people who saw the brochure
- **Accepts:** Number who took the brochure
- **Interviews:** Number who engaged in conversation
- **Contacts:** Number who reached out afterward

### Conversion Rate
- Conversion Rate = people given brochures ÷ people who took action
- Conversion varies by industry and segment
- **Target:** 15%+ for a specific, targeted segment

### Quality of Response
When customers take action to reach out, that's a good sign you're on the right track.

This differs from landing pages where people just leave their email. With a brochure call-to-action, customers are more proactive - they take the material home, read through it, then call or email you to learn more about your value proposition.

## Skills Required

- Marketing / Research

Brochure experiments require design skills to create a visually appealing experience with high-quality images and styling. Otherwise, you may create false negatives in testing - people won't believe your value proposition is real.

Content is equally important. You need to write clear, concise sentences that empathize with your customers.

## Requirements

### Outreach Plan
Brochures differ from digital online experiments - you need to interact directly with people to distribute them.

Plan what you're trying to achieve and where to find your customers before finalizing a brochure.

**Brainstorm locations:**
- Conferences
- Meetups
- Events
- Coffee shops
- Stores
- Door-to-door
