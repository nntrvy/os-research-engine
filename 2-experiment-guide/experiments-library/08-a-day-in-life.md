# A Day in Life

Một ngày trong cuộc sống

## Purpose

A qualitative research method using ethnographic study of customers to better understand their jobs, pains, and gains.

**✅ Ideal for:** Observing real customer behavior in their natural environment

**❌ Not ideal for:** Quick validation - requires significant time investment

## Preparation

1. **Form teams** of 2-3 people
2. **Identify location** and how you plan to observe
3. **Clear your schedule** to commit several hours to observation
4. **Define note-taking method** and set ground rules to avoid biasing participants

## Execution

### 1. Permission
- Get consent from people you want to observe
- Explain the "why" behind your request

### 2. Observation
Using the Day in Life worksheet, capture:
- Time
- Activity
- Customer jobs
- Customer pains
- Customer gains
- Your thoughts and notes

**Important:** Don't interview or interact with participants during observation.

### 3. Analysis
After the observation session ends, meet with your team to sort notes. Update Value Proposition Canvas to reflect latest findings and inform future experiments.

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

Relatively cheap. You may need to compensate people for their time if you decide to work with or observe them for the full day.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Short (identify and get consent from participants) |
| Running | Several hours per day, possibly several days or weeks |

Running time depends on number of participants you observe.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Weak to Medium** (2-3/5)

### Customer Jobs, Pains, Gains
- Notes and activities based on observing customer jobs, pains, and gains throughout the day
- After grouping and ranking, this is relatively weak evidence, though stronger than bringing people into a lab (because it observes real-world behavior)

### Customer Quotes
- Additional quotes from customers beyond just jobs, pains, and gains
- Relatively weak evidence but useful for providing context and qualitative lessons for upcoming experiments

## Skills Required

- Research

Almost anyone can use the Day in Life experiment. Having research ability to properly collect and record data is helpful. We recommend having a partner to compare notes with.

## Requirements

**Consent**

The Day in Life experiment ideally requires consent from the people you're observing. It also requires you to coordinate with management and security at locations where you observe.

**Example:** If you plan to wander around a retail store and observe shoppers, talk to the manager first for permission. If you want to observe shoppers directly, remember to ask their permission before doing so. Otherwise, this can become creepy and you may be escorted out by security.

## Observation Guidelines

### ✅ Do:
- Stay unobtrusive
- Take notes quietly
- Record exact behaviors (not interpretations)
- Note time of each observation
- Capture body language and facial expressions
- Write down verbatim quotes when possible
- Observe environment and context

### ❌ Don't:
- Interrupt or ask questions during observation
- Make assumptions about why they're doing something
- Let them know you're judging their behavior
- Skip the debrief with your observation partner
- Observe without consent

## Debrief Questions

After each observation session, discuss with your team:

1. What surprised us?
2. What jobs did we observe?
3. What pains were evident?
4. What gains did they seem to seek?
5. What workarounds or hacks did we notice?
6. What questions do we still have?
7. How does this change our assumptions?

## When to Use This Experiment

Best suited for:
- Products/services used in daily routines
- Understanding context of use
- Discovering jobs you didn't know existed
- Seeing pain points customers don't mention in interviews
- Validating assumptions from surveys and interviews
