# Pre-sale

Bán trước

## Purpose

A sale organized before the item is available to purchase. Unlike a mock sale, you're processing a real money transaction when goods are delivered.

**✅ Ideal for:** Measuring market demand at a smaller scale before you launch to the public

## Preparation

1. **Create a simple landing page**
2. **Insert your pricing options**
3. **On click to select price:** Display a popup with "Product not yet available on the market" and a payment information form
   - Card will not be charged until you ship the product
4. **Integrate and test** that your analytics tools are working correctly

## Execution

1. Make your page public
2. Drive traffic to your page

## Analysis

Review your analytics on number of people who:
- View your pricing options
- Click on a price option
- Fill in their payment information
- Click pre-order to be charged when delivered
- Exit the flow (i.e., leave the website analytics funnel)

Review conversion on your page based on traffic source.

Use these findings to assess viability and refine your Value Proposition and pricing options.

## Connections

- Pricing options come from **Revenue Streams** in your Business Model Canvas

## Cost

💰 **Low to Medium** (2-3/5)

Relatively cheap, but unlike mock sales, you have additional costs for processing transactions and shipping products.

If using a point of sale (POS) system, you may need additional hardware or software costs.

Most payment systems charge a percentage of your sales (2-3%) and may charge monthly fees on top of that.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Short |
| Running | Days to weeks |

When preparing to ship products to customers, you need time to set up acceptance and processing of financial information.

You'll want to target a specific audience with your solution and give them enough time to consider the purchase.

**Note:** Pre-sale experiments usually don't run too long - payment providers may require product delivery within 20 days of purchase.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Very Strong** (5/5)

### Unique Views
- Number of people who saw your pricing page

### Purchases - Very Strong
- **Conversion Rate** = people who view price ÷ number of purchases

Purchases are strong evidence. Customers are paying for your solution before it's officially available.

### Abandonments - Very Strong
- Primarily relates to online shopping carts
- If people start the purchase process but then leave, they're abandoning the purchase
- **Abandonment Rate** = total completed purchases ÷ people who entered the purchase process

Abandonment is strong evidence, though a bad sign. It means something is wrong in your process - the flow might be incorrect or the purchase price may not be right.

## Skills Required

- Design / Sales / Finance

Pre-sale experiments require you to:
- Define pricing options
- Design sales in a way that best fits your target audience
- Have selling skills, especially when running experiments in the real world

## Requirements

### Ability to Fulfill
Pre-sale differs from mock sale: you're collecting and processing payment information, conducting an actual sales activity.

This means your solution should be relatively close to completion, or at least have a minimum viable product to deliver.

Don't rush to pre-sell if you can't fulfill your promise to customers.
