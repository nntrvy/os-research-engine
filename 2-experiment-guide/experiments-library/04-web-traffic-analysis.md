# Web Traffic Analysis

Phân tích lượng truy cập web

## Purpose

Use website data collection, reporting, and analysis to find customer behavior patterns.

**✅ Ideal for:** Finding customer behavior patterns on your existing website

## Preparation

1. **Create your focus area** and customer event for:
   - Increasing registrations
   - Increasing downloads
   - Increasing purchases

2. **Identify steps** leading to that event

3. **Choose timeframe** for your analysis

## Execution

1. Using web analytics software, run your analysis on the defined path
2. Note drop-off points and percentage at each point

## Analysis

- What is the biggest drop-off point in your flow?
- What experiments can you run to improve that number?

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

- Relatively cheap, especially with free tools like Google Analytics
- If you want deeper event-level tracking and pay for a tool, there are many price tiers
- Some start very cheap, but as your customer traffic increases, costs may increase
- Heat map analysis tools also have low-cost options

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Few hours to a few days |
| Running | Few weeks to months |

You need to integrate the tool into your website and log into the dashboard to view data. Depending on the tool, it may take a day or more to get the data.

**Running time is long** - you won't want to make big, risky decisions based on a few days of analytics data.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Variable** (1-4/5)

### Sessions - Very Weak (1/5)
- Number of interactions on your website in a given timeframe, for a specific user
- Usually within a 30-minute period

### Drop-off - Weak (2/5)
- Drop-off occurs when users exit the experiment flow you defined
- Calculate drop-off rate at steps and whether they leave the website completely
- Number of customers on website and where they exit are relatively strong evidence as it measures what customers do
- You won't know *why* they did it until you ask them

### Attention - Strong (4/5)
- Attention can include different user actions, usually including time on page and where they click
- Users don't continuously click buttons and links, so having heat map data can provide amazing lessons about how you gain or lose customer attention on your website
- Attention is also relatively strong evidence, but like sessions and drop-off, it only tells you "what" not "why"

## Skills Required

- Technology / Data

Web traffic analysis is becoming increasingly complex, especially when you go beyond the basics of user behavior. We recommend having:
- Technical ability to integrate analytics software
- Data knowledge to analyze results

Example: Heat map data will tell you where people clicked, but you'll want to segment that data by source to see if users from online ads click differently than those from email campaigns.

## Requirements

**Traffic**

Web traffic analysis experiments require you to have a website with active users, otherwise you can't collect any evidence.

Similar to simple landing pages, we recommend driving traffic to your website using:
- Online ads
- Social media campaigns
- Email campaigns
- Word of mouth
- Discussion forums
