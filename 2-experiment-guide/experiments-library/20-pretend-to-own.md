# Pretend to Own

Giả vờ sở hữu (Pinocchio Test)

## Purpose

Create a non-functional, low-fidelity prototype of the solution to determine if it's suitable for use in the customer's daily life.

Sometimes called the Pinocchio experiment - like the wooden puppet who wanted to become a real boy, your prototype wants to become a real product.

**✅ Ideal for:** Creating your own evidence about the potential usefulness of an idea

## Preparation

1. **Sketch product idea** on paper
2. **Gather materials** needed for the pretend-to-own experiment
3. **Set timeframe** for product creation to avoid too many internal iterations
4. **Create your pretend-to-own product**
5. **Create experiment journal** to track metrics

## Execution

1. **Run the pretend-to-own experiment**, using it as if it were a fully functional product
2. **Track your usage** in an experiment journal

## Analysis

Review your journal for events:
- How many times did you use it?
- Were there certain aspects of the product that were difficult or awkward?

Use your results to inform higher-fidelity experiments.

## Cost

💰 **Very Low** (1/5)

Very cheap - you're using available materials like wood and paper. Cost can increase with product size and complexity.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Minutes to hours |
| Running | Weeks to months |

Don't iterate too many times on internal design - focus on creating the product's shape and user interface.

Running time can be weeks to months, depending on the nature of your idea. You'll want extra time to test, to (almost) forget it's not real.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Weak** (2/5)

### Usage Journal
- **When do you use it?** Keep a spreadsheet tracking available time and number of occurrences you thought about using it
- **Document usage type** and situation

Overall usage is relatively weak evidence, but you'll learn direct lessons that can help shape your idea and value proposition.

## Skills Required

- Design / Research

Basic design and research skills are helpful when running a pretend-to-own experiment. You need the ability to create a rough model and then journal your activities over time.

## Requirements

Pretend-to-own experiments don't require much to get started: just an idea you want to validate and some creativity about how to make a non-functional copy of it.

## What to Observe

### Physical Products
- Does it fit in your pocket/bag/space?
- Is it the right weight?
- Is it comfortable to hold?
- When do you naturally reach for it?

### Digital Products (Paper Prototype)
- Do you naturally look at it at certain times?
- What information do you want to see first?
- What actions do you try to take?

### Services
- When do you think about needing it?
- What triggers the need?
- How often does the need arise?

## Example: Smartphone Case Study

### Before Smartphones Existed
A product designer created a wooden block the size of a potential smartphone with paper "screens" they could swap out. They carried it for 2 weeks.

### Learnings
- Reached for it 40+ times per day
- Wanted it most during commute and waiting
- Size in back pocket was uncomfortable
- One-handed use was important

### Impact
These insights shaped early smartphone design decisions.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Make it the realistic size and weight
- Actually carry/place it where real product would be
- Be honest in your journal
- Involve others in the experiment
- Run for at least 1-2 weeks

### ❌ Don't:
- Over-engineer the prototype
- Substitute imagination for actual testing
- Skip the journal
- End too early
- Ignore uncomfortable findings
