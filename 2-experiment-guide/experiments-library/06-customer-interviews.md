# Customer Interviews

Phỏng vấn khách hàng

## Purpose

A focused interview to discover Jobs, Pains, Gains, and Willingness to Pay.

**✅ Ideal for:** Getting qualitative lessons about fit between your value proposition and customer segment. Also a good starting point for price validation.

**❌ Not ideal for:** Validating what people will actually do (only what they say they'll do)

## Preparation

1. **Write a script** to learn about:
   - Customer jobs, pains, and gains (J, P, G)
   - Willingness to pay (WTP)
   - Unmet needs between product and solution

2. **Recruit participants**

3. **Choose timeframe** for your analysis

## Execution

1. **Interviewer** asks questions from script and digs deeper when needed
2. **Note-taker** captures exact phrases and body language of participant
3. **Repeat** for 15-20 interviews
4. **Collect, sort, and synthesize** evidence (on whiteboard and in database)

## Analysis

1. **15-minute debrief** immediately after each interview while impressions are fresh
2. **Affinity sort** the notes
3. **Perform ranking analysis**
4. **Update Value Proposition Canvas**

## Writing the Script

Scripts are critical for effective customer interviews. Without them, interviews often become rambling conversations that rarely yield insights.

**Build your script after** you have a Value Proposition Canvas and rankings for top three jobs, pains, and gains.

### Sample Script

**1. Introduction & Context**
- "Hi, I'm [name] researching [topic]"
- "There's no pressure to buy anything here"
- "We're also not selling you anything"

**2. Ask for Stories**
- "When was the last time you experienced [pain or job]?"
- "What motivated you to take [action]?"
- "How did you solve it?"
- "If not, why?"

**3. Rank Jobs, Pains, and Gains**
- List top three items from each category
- Have interviewee rank them based on personal experience
- "Is there anything else you'd like to see on this list?"

**4. Thank & Close**
- "What question should I have asked you?"
- "Can you introduce me to someone else?"
- "Can we contact you again in the future?"
- "Thank you!"

## Recruiting Participants

### B2C Segment
Create a Value Proposition Canvas for your B2C segment, then brainstorm where you can find them both offline and online. Vote as a team on where to focus your search.

### B2B Segment
Apply the same approach for B2B interview candidates, though it may be harder to think of where to find them. Fortunately, there are online and offline locations that are generally effective for finding B2B interview participants.

### Screening Participants

Screening isn't foolproof, but it saves time by filtering out unqualified people.

**Craigslist Screening Example:**
- Go to Community → Volunteers section
- Post your research request with a survey link
- Include qualifying/disqualifying questions
- Example: "How many bicycles do you own? 0, 1, 2, 3+?"
  - If 0: Disqualify (doesn't own a bike)
  - If 3+: May disqualify (already owns many bikes)

**In-Person Screening:**
- Ask screening questions directly before the full interview
- If they don't qualify, thank them and move on

## Roles & Responsibilities

Don't do interviews alone, whether online or in-person. It's difficult to ask questions, actively listen, note body language, respond, and ask follow-ups all at once.

### Recommended Team of Two:

**Note-Taker:**
- Takes notes
- Writes exact quotes when possible (don't interpret)
- Describes body language

**Interviewer:**
- Asks questions from script
- Digs deeper when needed by asking "why"
- Thanks and closes

**Participant:**
- Answers questions

## 15-Minute Debrief

Immediately after each interview, spend 15 minutes with your teammate to summarize learnings and identify needed modifications.

**Debrief Topics:**
- What did the interview do well?
- What did we learn from body language?
- Did we bias the candidate in any way?
- Is there anything we want to quickly fix in the script?

## Synthesizing Feedback

### Affinity Sorting
Spend 30-60 minutes as a team with your notes.

1. If meeting in person, ensure you have plenty of wall space
2. Write one quote per sticky note
3. Write one lesson per sticky note
4. Put interviewee name or initials at bottom of sticky
5. Put all stickies on the wall
6. Sort them into similar themes

### Ranking Analysis

Ranking isn't perfect science, but gives you a sense of how close you are to the actual ranking in your customer profile.

If you interview 10 customers matching your customer profile, ideally you want the order of jobs, pains, and gains to be 80% accurate. That means 8 out of 10 people have job 1 as #1, job 2 as #2, job 3 as #3, etc.

### Update Your Canvas

After synthesizing qualitative feedback and ranking analysis from your first batch of customer interviews, return to your Value Proposition Canvas and make any necessary edits.

## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do:
- Ask permission before recording
- Screen candidates so you don't waste each other's time
- Approach with beginner's mindset
- Listen more than talk
- Collect facts, not opinions
- Ask "why" to discover true motivation
- Ask permission to follow up
- Request referrals for interviews
- Ask if there's anything you should have asked

### ❌ Don't:
- Talk more than listen
- Offer solutions
- Think about next question instead of actively listening to answers
- Nod yes or no while interviewee is speaking
- Only ask closed-ended questions
- Schedule back-to-back interviews with no debrief time
- Forget to update Value Proposition Canvas with findings
