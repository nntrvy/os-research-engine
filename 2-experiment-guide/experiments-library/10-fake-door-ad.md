# Fake Door Ad / Online Advertising

Quảng cáo trực tuyến

## Purpose

An online ad that clearly presents a value proposition to a target customer segment with a simple call-to-action.

**✅ Ideal for:** Quickly validating your value proposition at scale with online customers

## Finding Customer Segments

Finding customer segments online can be challenging, but with creativity it's completely possible. Start thinking about this early, before designing your experiment.

**Example:** When building your Value Proposition Canvas, spend time brainstorming different places you can find your target customer online. Then vote as a team on where you want to test first.

## Understanding Customer Stage

After prioritizing locations to find customers, customize your approach based on what stage the customer is in.

Use Steve Blank's model to inform your customer acquisition strategy.

## Two Approaches

### Push Approach - Facebook/LinkedIn/TikTok
**[People with problems who are aware of their problems]**

For customers with problems who are aware of them, use a push approach to bring them to your experiment. Leverage advertising to create targeted ads.

With display advertising, you can segment people by interests and "push" your experiment to them.

### Pull Approach - Google Ads
**[People searching for a solution]**

For people actively searching for solutions, you need to appear when they're looking.

"Pull-based acquisition" means ensuring your experiment is displayed when people search online for solutions to their problems. Using search advertising, you can narrow search terms (keywords) and "pull" them to your value proposition.

| Setup | Minutes (text) to hours (with images) |
| Approval | 1-3 days |
| Running | At least 1 week |

## Evidence Strength

### Click-Through Rate (CTR)

Users clicking on ads is relatively weak evidence, but necessary for validating customer acquisition channels.

Can be combined with conversions on a simple landing page to create stronger overall evidence.

## Skills Required

- Design / Product / Marketing

Running online ads is much easier than before, primarily because platforms provide step-by-step guidance. You still need the ability to design ads that convey your value proposition with appropriate call-to-action and target audience.

## Requirements

**Destination - Landing Page**

You need a destination for target audiences once they click the ad. Most destinations are landing pages. Platforms have become more restrictive over the years, so the page needs to match the overall value proposition and meet website destination requirements.

Review these requirements before running ads, or they'll be rejected during approval.
