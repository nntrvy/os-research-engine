# Crowdfunding

Gây quỹ cộng đồng

## Purpose

Funding a project or business venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet.

**✅ Ideal for:** Raising funds for your new business venture with customers who believe in your value proposition

**❌ Not ideal for:** Determining whether your new business venture is viable

## Preparation

1. **Determine funding goal amount** - Be realistic and specific about how funds will be used for activities needed to create the product

2. **Choose crowdfunding platform** or create a custom crowdfunding website

3. **Create crowdfunding video**
   - Must be high quality and engaging to persuade users to fund your product
   - Include value proposition statement below video in large font (headline size)
   - Place call-to-action to fund your product on the right side of video in clear language
   - Present content about customer pains, your solution, and benefits below the value proposition
   - Have different pledge amounts with corresponding perks

## Execution

1. Make your crowdfunding campaign public
2. Drive traffic to your page
3. Be active on social media and your campaign page by responding to comments and questions

## Analysis

- Review how many pledges you received, amount per pledge, and whether you achieved your funding goal
- If you didn't reach goal: Use learnings to redo the crowdfunding campaign
- If you reached goal: Continue actively responding about your progress to backers through social media and email
- Analyze conversion rates from different traffic sources (e.g., which social media or email campaign drove more pledges - remember this for customer acquisition when product launches)

## Campaign Page Connections

1. **Hero Section:** Your video should tell a story, focusing on the most compelling elements. Show how your solution will solve top jobs, pains, and gains for the customer segment in your customer profile.

2. **Pains:** Take the three most-voted customer pains and include them in the pain description section on the lower left of the campaign page.

3. **Solution:** From the Value Map's Products and Services. Potential backers should understand the solution, placed next to customer pains on the campaign page.

4. **Benefits:** Take the three most-voted customer gains and include them in the benefits description on the lower right of the campaign page.

## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do:
- Include crowdfunding platform commission percentage as a cost in your campaign
- Refund contributors if you don't reach your goal
- Be specific and transparent about how funds you're raising will be used, including operational costs
- Create realistic perks that won't consume all your time

### ❌ Don't:
- Be greedy and raise more than you need to build the product
- Cut video production quality
- Make unrealistic claims about product benefits
- Have too many perks that consume all your time fulfilling them

## Cost

💰 **Medium to High** (3-4/5)

Costs typically center around:
- Video production
- Marketing
- Logistics
- Campaign duration

While crowdfunding platforms are available, campaigns need to be highly authentic or you won't attract customer interest.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Weeks to months |
| Running | 30-60 days |

Creating a compelling, high-quality video that conveys the value proposition, pledge amounts, and perks takes significant effort.

Running typically takes 30-60 days. This doesn't mean you can't succeed spectacularly in fewer days - but those cases (funded in a few days) are exceptions.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Strong to Very Strong** (4-5/5)

### Engagement - Weak (2/5)
- **Referrers:** Where visitors come from and how they interact with your campaign
- **Unique views, comments, social shares:** All relatively weak evidence but useful for qualitative lessons

### Pledges - Very Strong (5/5)
- How viewers are converting to pledging their money
- **Target:** At least 6% of pledges from direct traffic
- **Target:** At least 2% of pledges from targeted online ads
- **Funding percentage:** Ideally 100% and your idea gets funded

Viewers pledging money to help your crowdfunding campaign succeed is very strong evidence. They're voting with their wallets, not just words.

## Skills Required

- Design / Product / Marketing / Finance

The popularity of crowdfunding has created an increase in platforms, meaning you don't need an entire development team to create a campaign.

What you need is to create a credible campaign with interesting perks while building awareness in the market.

**Design** is important - everything must look professional, or you may receive false negatives about your value proposition.

**Finance** plays a bigger role - you need to accurately define your pledge amounts and perks, hoping to build a sustainable business from the campaign and customer perks.

## Requirements

### Value Proposition & Customer Segment
Before jumping into a crowdfunding campaign, you need a clear value proposition - deliverable through a high-quality video - and a target customer segment.

It's rare for crowdfunding campaigns to not use video, and if they don't, success rates are quite low.

You'll want to know who you're targeting, otherwise it's very difficult to direct people to your crowdfunding campaign.
