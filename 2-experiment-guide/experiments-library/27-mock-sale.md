# Mock Sale

Bán giả

## Purpose

Simulate a sales experience without actually processing real transactions. Customers go through the entire purchase flow but no money changes hands.

**✅ Ideal for:** Testing purchase intent and validating pricing before building payment infrastructure

## Preparation

1. **Create product/service presentation** with pricing
2. **Design the purchase flow** (landing page, checkout page)
3. **Set up tracking** to measure how far customers go
4. **Prepare "coming soon" or "waitlist" messaging** for after they try to buy

## Execution

1. **Drive traffic** to your sales page
2. **Track customer behavior** through the funnel
3. **Capture contact info** of those who attempted to purchase

## Analysis

- How many viewed pricing?
- How many clicked "buy"?
- How many completed the (mock) checkout flow?
- What's the drop-off at each stage?
- Contact those who tried to buy for deeper feedback

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

No payment processing costs. Just landing page and traffic costs.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | 1-2 days |
| Running | 1-2 weeks |

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Strong** (4/5)

### Attempted Purchases - Strong Evidence

- Stronger than just email sign-ups

### Funnel Drop-off - Medium Evidence
- Shows where friction exists
- Indicates pricing sensitivity

## Skills Required

- Design / Marketing / Sales

## Requirements

- Clear pricing structure
- Realistic purchase flow
- Traffic source
