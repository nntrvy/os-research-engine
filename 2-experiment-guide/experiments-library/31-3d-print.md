# 3D Print

In 3D

## Purpose

Create physical prototypes using 3D printing technology to test form, fit, and function with real users.

**✅ Ideal for:** Physical product testing without expensive manufacturing tooling

## Preparation

1. **Create 3D design** (CAD software or hire designer)
2. **Choose materials** appropriate for your test (PLA, ABS, resin, etc.)
3. **Select printing method:**
   - DIY (if you have a printer)
   - Online service (Shapeways, Sculpteo)
   - Local maker space
4. **Plan testing sessions** with users

## Execution

1. **Print prototypes** (may need multiple iterations)
2. **Test with users:**
   - Let them handle it
   - Observe usage
   - Collect feedback
3. **Iterate on design** based on findings

## Analysis

- Does the form factor work?
- Is it comfortable to use?
- What would users change?
- Is the size/weight appropriate?
- What materials would the final product need?

## Cost

💰 **Low to Medium** (2-3/5)

| Method | Cost |
|--------|------|
| DIY printer | $200-500 (one-time) + materials |
| Online service | $20-200 per print |
| Maker space | $10-50 per session |

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Design | 1-3 days |
| Printing | Hours to days |
| Testing | 1-2 weeks |

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium** (3/5)

### Physical Testing - Medium Evidence
- Real hands-on feedback
- Validates ergonomics and usability

### User Preference - Weak Evidence
- "I like this better" statements
- Informs design direction

## Skills Required

- Product Design / CAD / 3D Printing Knowledge

Basic understanding of 3D printing constraints and design for manufacturing.

## Requirements

- 3D design files (STL, OBJ)
- Access to 3D printer or service
- Test users

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Start with rough prototypes
- Test early and often
- Iterate based on feedback
- Use appropriate materials
- Document each version

### ❌ Don't:
- Over-engineer first prototype
- Skip user testing
- Use expensive materials too early
