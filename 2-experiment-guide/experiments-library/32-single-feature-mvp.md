# Single Feature MVP

MVP Tính năng đơn

## Purpose

Build the absolute minimum product with only one core feature to test your most critical assumption.

**✅ Ideal for:** Validating your core value proposition before building a full product

## Preparation

1. **Identify your single most important feature**
   - What is the ONE thing that creates value?
   - What's the riskiest assumption?
2. **Strip away everything else**
   - No nice-to-haves
   - No future features
   - No polish
3. **Define success criteria**
4. **Build only what's necessary** for that one feature

## Execution

1. **Launch to a small group** of target users
2. **Measure usage** of the core feature
3. **Collect feedback** on whether it solves their problem
4. **Track key metrics** defined in success criteria

## Analysis

- Do users use the core feature?
- Does it solve their problem?
- Would they pay for it?
- What's missing that would make them pay more?
- Should we continue building?

## Cost

💰 **Medium** (3/5)

- Development time for core feature
- Depends on complexity

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Design | 1-2 weeks |
| Build | 2-4 weeks |
| Test | 2-4 weeks |

Total: 5-10 weeks

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Very Strong** (5/5)

### Feature Usage - Strong Evidence
- Users actually using the feature
- Validates utility

### Payment - Very Strong Evidence
- Users paying for the single feature
- Validates willingness to pay

### Retention - Very Strong Evidence
- Users coming back
- Validates ongoing value

## Skills Required

- Product / Design / Development

## Requirements

- Clear understanding of core value proposition
- Ability to build the feature
- Access to target users

## "Is It Ready?" Checklist

Before launching your Single Feature MVP:

- [ ] Does it deliver the core value?
- [ ] Can users complete the main job?
- [ ] Can you measure success?
- [ ] Is it stable enough for testing?
- [ ] Can you onboard users quickly?

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Be ruthless about cutting features
- Talk to users constantly
- Measure one key metric obsessively
- Ship faster than comfortable
- Learn, don't prove

### ❌ Don't:
- Add "just one more feature"
- Wait until it's polished
- Launch to too many people
- Ignore negative feedback
- Build before validating
