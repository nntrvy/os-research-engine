# Email Campaign

Chiến dịch email

## Purpose

Email messages deployed over a specific time period to customers.

**✅ Ideal for:** Quickly validating your value proposition with a customer segment

**❌ Not ideal for:** Replacing direct customer interaction

## Preparation

1. **Define email campaign objectives**
2. **Create a series of "drip emails"** to provide incremental value to customers over days or weeks
3. **Send internal test emails** to review content and visuals

## Execution

1. Run your email campaign with customers
2. Respond to customers who reply to your emails

## Analysis

Analyze which emails are performing best:
- What type of content is driving the most opens?
- What type of content is driving the most clicks?
- What type of content is driving the most email replies?

Summarize with your team and decide what modifications to make for the next campaign.

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

Relatively cheap - there are cost-effective services to manage email creation, distribution, and analysis across large numbers of subscribers (Kit, Mailchimp, etc.).

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Minutes to hours |
| Running | 1-2 days to 3-4 weeks |

Using modern email tools, it only takes a few minutes to hours to create a campaign. You can create automated drip emails that send on a schedule over time without manual intervention.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium** (3/5)

### Key Metrics
- **Open Rate** = unique clicks ÷ unique opens
- **Click Rate** = percentage of people who clicked at least one link in your email
- **Exit Rate** = people who left the sequence
- **Unsubscribe Rate** = people who opted out

Open and click rates vary by industry. Use industry guidelines to determine what's average for your experiment. These can be found in most email service tools as part of the reporting package.

Email opens and clicks are medium evidence.

## Skills Required

- Design / Product / Marketing

Email campaigns are relatively easy to create and manage with many specialized tools and services available today. You still need the ability to write clear, coherent content with compelling visuals and a strong call-to-action. Most formatting can be handled by ready-made online templates.

## Requirements

### Subscriber List
Email campaigns require subscribers before you can use them effectively. You can get subscribers from various sources:
- Social media campaigns
- Website sign-ups
- Blog posts with email sign-up
- Word of mouth
- Discussion forums

### Campaign Objectives
Email campaigns need objectives, otherwise you can't be confident they're helping you make progress.

Objectives can vary from:
- Driving traffic to a page for conversion
- Educating new customers
- Building trust
- Learning customer needs
- Re-engaging current or lost customers

Create an objective before investing effort in an email campaign.

## Case Study: Product Hunt

### Background
Product Hunt is a website that lets users share and discover new products. It started in a Philz Coffee shop as a 20-minute experiment by Ryan Hoover, primarily using email.

### Hypothesis
Ryan believed that product makers would join an online community to share, discover, and discuss new and interesting products.

### Experiment
Create the first version of Product Hunt as an email campaign.

In just 20 minutes, Ryan created a group on Linkydink, a link-sharing tool built by Makeshift. At the time, it allowed people to share links with a group and send them as a daily email.

He then invited a few of his startup friends to contribute to the group. To promote it, Ryan announced the experiment on Quibb (a tech-focused online community) and Twitter.

### Evidence
**Opens, clicks, and shares**

Within two weeks, over 200 people had signed up to discover products from 30 carefully selected contributors, including startup founders, VCs, and notable bloggers. Ryan also received unsolicited emails and in-person conversations expressing love and support for the project.

### Insight
It really was a problem. The response was very positive and unlike most emails that are opened and clicked (or not), Ryan had a public audience contributing and sharing links via email. He had built a network over the years of entrepreneurs and product people who craved such an environment. Clearly there was an unmet need for a community for product enthusiasts, based on the sheer volume of activity from his email list.

### Action
Turn user behavior from email into a platform.

Ryan used what he learned from the experiment to inform the design and technology of Product Hunt as a community platform. Since then, Product Hunt graduated from Y Combinator (YC S14) and was acquired by AngelList for $20 million in 2016. It became the place for makers and startups to introduce their new products to a global community of founders, journalists, investors, and technology enthusiasts.
