Video Giải Thích

## Purpose

A short video focused on explaining a business idea in a simple, engaging, and compelling way.

**✅ Ideal for:** Quickly explaining your value proposition to a large number of customers

## Preparation

1. **Write script** for your explainer video
2. **Use connections** from Value Proposition Canvas to inform script content and visuals
3. **Create your explainer video** (e.g., using Loom)
4. **Upload video** to social media platform, video platform, email, or landing page
5. **Test** that video analytics and call-to-action links are working

## Execution

1. **Make your video public**
2. **Drive traffic** to your video
3. **If comments are enabled,** respond to viewer questions about the solution

## Analysis

- How many views and shares did the video receive?
- What is your click-through rate?
- Are people coming from the video to your landing page converting?
- Use learnings to adjust video content

**Note:** It's common to have different video versions depending on your target customers and platform.

## Connections

1. **Lead with pain:** Start with the biggest customer pain from Customer Profile
2. **Introduce solution:** Present the solution from Value Map that addresses that pain
3. **Show benefits:** Illustrate the gains from Customer Profile when the pain is solved
4. **End with CTA:** Close with a call-to-action link to assess desirability level

## Cost

💰 **Low to Medium** (2-3/5)

- Relatively cheap, but can quickly become expensive depending on production value
- Many products allow you to create adequate quality explainer videos
- If you want to stand out, may need additional cost for professional filming
- Also consider how you'll drive traffic to the explainer video as part of the cost

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Days to weeks |
| Running | Weeks to months |

Good explainer videos take several days or weeks to set up. You need to think clearly about how to communicate your value proposition, write a script, do multiple takes, and edit.

Running time is relatively long unless the video goes viral. Viral videos get a lot of buzz, but they're exceptions. Most explainer videos require a lot of effort to attract traffic, including paid advertising and social media.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Medium** (3/5)

### Views & Shares - Weak (2/5)
- **Unique Views:** How many unique views and from which referral sources
- **Shares:** How many shares and through which platform

Views and shares are relatively weak evidence.

### Clicks - Medium (3/5)
- **Click-Through Rate** = clicks your video receives ÷ number of views

Clicks are stronger evidence because people are clicking to learn more.

### Comments - Weak (2/5)
- Viewer comments about usability, pricing, and how it works
- Relatively weak evidence but sometimes good for qualitative lessons

## Skills Required

- Design / Product / Technology

You need the ability to:
- Write a compelling video script
- Create the video
- Edit the video
- Share and promote it to your target audience

Explainer videos need a clear call-to-action, usually at the end, to encourage your audience to click and learn more.

## Requirements

**Traffic**

Explainer videos need traffic to generate evidence, whether they exist on a video platform, social media, email, or landing page.
