Dịch vụ Concierge

## Purpose

Manually deliver your service to customers to validate demand before building automated systems.

**✅ Ideal for:** Testing service businesses, marketplaces, or any solution that can be manually fulfilled

**❌ Not ideal for:** Scaling - this is meant for learning, not growth

## Preparation

1. **Define the service** you'll deliver manually
2. **Identify first customers** (usually from your network)
3. **Create simple processes** for:
   - Customer intake
   - Service delivery
   - Feedback collection
4. **Set pricing** (even if discounted)

## Execution

1. **Recruit first customers**
2. **Deliver the service manually** - do whatever it takes
3. **Document everything:**
   - Time spent
   - Steps taken
   - Customer reactions
   - Problems encountered
4. **Collect feedback** after each delivery

## Analysis

- Would customers pay (more) for this?
- What steps took the most time?
- What could be automated?
- What surprised you about customer needs?
- Is this viable as a business?

## Cost

💰 **Medium** (3/5)

- Primarily your time
- Some operational costs
- May need to subsidize pricing initially

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | 1-2 weeks |
| Running | 4-8 weeks (10-20 customers) |
