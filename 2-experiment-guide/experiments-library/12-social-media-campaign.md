# Social Media Campaign

Chiến dịch truyền thông xã hội

## Purpose

Social media messages deployed over a specific time period to customers.

**✅ Ideal for:** Acquiring new customers, increasing brand loyalty, and driving sales

## Preparation

1. **Define campaign objectives**
2. **Identify platforms** to use
3. **Create editorial calendar** and posting schedule
4. **Create social media content**

## Execution

1. Post content on platforms according to schedule
2. Monitor, respond, and engage with commenters

## Analysis

Analyze which posts and platforms are performing best:
- What type of content is getting the most shares?
- What type of content is driving the most clicks?
- What type of content is attracting the most comments?
- What type of content is driving the most conversions?

Summarize with your team and decide what modifications to make for the next campaign.

## Cost

💰 **Low to Medium** (2-3/5)

- Moderately cheap if you do the work yourself and don't pay for social media advertising
- Costs can rise quickly ($5k-$20k per month) if you pay someone to manage and create content

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Days to weeks (depending on content volume) |
| Running | Weeks to months |

Setup time increases if running on multiple platforms. Running time includes posting, reading, and responding on social media, plus measuring effectiveness against business goals.

## Evidence Strength

### Engagement - Weak (2/5)
- **Views:** Number of people who saw your posts
- **Shares:** Number of times content was shared
- **Comments:** Feedback and discussions

Engagement is fairly weak evidence. You can learn deep qualitative lessons from comments to inform your value proposition.

### Click-Through Rate - Weak to Medium (2-3/5)
- CTR = views your social media post receives ÷ people who clicked

### Conversion Rate - Strong (4/5)
- Conversion Rate = people who clicked social media link ÷ people who used it to sign up or purchase

Conversions are strong evidence and can help you identify which social media platform works best for driving business.

## Skills Required

- Design / Marketing

**Marketing:** Create, respond, and manage social media across multiple platforms

**Design:** Help shape and visualize content before posting

## Requirements

**Content**

Social media campaigns aren't just about random posting - they're about scheduling posts for many weeks and months.

Without content, your campaign won't succeed. Make sure you have a plan and resources to create content before starting.
