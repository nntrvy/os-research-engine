# Discovery Survey

Khảo sát khám phá

## Purpose

An open-ended questionnaire used to collect information from a sample of customers.

**✅ Ideal for:** Discovering your Value Proposition - customer jobs, pains, and gains

**❌ Not ideal for:** Determining what people will do, only what they say they will do

## Sample Survey Questions

1. When was the last time you [insert scenario here]?
2. Can you explain what happened and how it affected you?
3. What other options did you explore? Why?
4. If you could wave a magic wand, what would you want to happen?
5. What question do you wish we had asked you?

## Preparation

1. **Define survey objectives** and what you're trying to learn
2. **Identify target audience** for your survey
3. **Calculate sample size** - assuming 10-20% response rate, calculate how many people you need
4. **Set start and stop dates** for the survey
5. **Create your survey**

## Execution

- Send your survey to customers

## Analysis

1. **Use affinity sorting technique** to group responses into themes
   - Don't label responses before sorting
   - Let sorting happen first, then label the groups

2. **Use word cloud** or text analysis tool to quickly visualize which words and phrases customers use most frequently

3. **Review themes and quotes** with your team
   - Vote on 1-3 themes you want to explore in more detail in upcoming experiments

4. **Update Value Proposition Canvas** based on results

## Cost

Survey tools like Google Forms, Typeform, and SurveyMonkey have free tiers.
