# Validation Survey

Khảo sát thẩm định

## Purpose

A closed-ended questionnaire used to collect information from a sample of customers about a specific topic.

**✅ Ideal for:** Getting deep insights about whether customers would be disappointed if your product disappeared

## Survey Types

### Ranking Jobs, Pains, and Gains
A common survey type to validate the priority order of jobs, pains, and gains in your Value Proposition Canvas (VPC).

Most teams make their best guesses about this ranking during setup, but need external feedback quickly to see how close they are to reality.

You can easily do this in most survey software by creating two boxes - one for the list and one next to it for customer ranking.

### Discovering Missed Jobs, Pains, and Gains
Beyond ranking, you can be inspired by discovery surveys and add an open-ended question after each ranking, in case you missed something:
- "What job would you like us to mention that isn't on this list? Why?"
- "What pain would you like us to mention that isn't on this list? Why?"
- "What gain would you like us to mention that isn't on this list? Why?"

### Other Validation Survey Types
Validation surveys are generally simple with closed responses to answer a single question. You can apply this to other assumptions you want to validate with customers:
- **CSAT** (Customer Satisfaction)
- **CES** (Customer Effort Score)
- **Brand Awareness**

## Sean Ellis Test

A popular survey type called the Sean Ellis Test, named after its creator and growth-hacking expert Sean Ellis.

His approach is to evaluate desirability through scarcity.

### The Key Question
> "How disappointed would you be if you could no longer use this product? Very disappointed, somewhat disappointed, or not disappointed?"

### The Benchmark
**40%+ "Very Disappointed" = Product/Market Fit**

You arguably don't achieve product/market fit until you reach 40%. If customers are indifferent and don't care if your product disappears, you have a desirability problem.

Scaling doesn't make sense before achieving fit - otherwise you may waste a lot of money scaling something nobody wants.

### Context Matters
**When to use it:**
- After customers have experienced your core product
- About 2 weeks after they've used it at least twice
- When they've seen real value

**Not when:**
- Right after they sign up (they haven't experienced it yet)
- 6 months after they stopped using it (experience has faded)

## NPS (Net Promoter Score)

One of the most popular survey types, widely applied by organizations worldwide.

### The Key Question
> "How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend or colleague? 0 (not at all) to 10 (very likely)"

### Calculation
```
% PROMOTERS (9-10) - % DETRACTORS (0-6) = NPS
```

- **Promoters:** Score 9-10
- **Passives:** Score 7-8 (not counted)
- **Detractors:** Score 0-6

### Benchmark
- **Above 0%** is considered good (varies by industry)
- Search online for industry benchmarks

### When to Use
Context when you present this to customers is crucial. Customers need to complete something meaningful in your product before they're ready to recommend it to friends or colleagues.

**Use NPS after the Sean Ellis Test.** Avoid scaling early based on hypothetical referrals from people who wouldn't be disappointed if your product disappeared.

## Cost

💰 **Low** (2/5)

Validation surveys aren't expensive since you already have a channel to reach customers. Today there are many tools and services that help you intercept active website customers through popups or emails when they trigger specific actions.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | A few hours to a day |
| Running | 1-3 days (with good distribution) |

If you have adequate distribution channels, a survey only takes 1-3 days to receive thousands of responses.

If you struggle to reach your audience, it may take several weeks to get the response volume you want.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Weak to Very Weak** (1-2/5)

### Sean Ellis Test
- **Target:** >40% "Very Disappointed" is ideal before scaling
- Relatively weak evidence, but suggesting the product might disappear attracts better customer feedback

### NPS
- **Target:** >0% is considered good (varies by industry)
- NPS survey data is weaker than Sean Ellis Test - you're getting answers to a theoretical referral situation

### Ranking Accuracy
- **Target:** 80% accuracy compared to Customer Profile
- When this is wrong, it creates ripple effects throughout your entire strategy
- Fairly weak evidence but an important step before moving to higher-stakes tests

## Skills Required

- Product / Marketing / Research

Validation surveys require the ability to ask questions skillfully with accurate tone and structure.

Since validation surveys target existing customers, you need to identify specific segments and sub-segments to help reduce noise in the data.

## Requirements

### Quantifiable Source Material
Validation surveys are meant for customers to respond about a situation, price, or feature. You need something for them to give feedback on that you can measure quantitatively.

### Existing Customer Channel
Validation surveys are valuable for current company customers, meaning you need to verify you can leverage existing channels to reach them - whether online via website, via email, or offline via direct mail or in-person delivery.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Time surveys to follow meaningful product experiences
- Keep surveys short (1-3 questions)
- Segment responses by customer type
- Follow up with qualitative interviews for "Very Disappointed" respondents
- Track trends over time

### ❌ Don't:
- Survey too early (before value experienced)
- Survey too frequently (causes fatigue)
- Ignore the context of responses
- Act on NPS without Sean Ellis validation first
- Assume high NPS means product/market fit
