A visual narrative showing how customers experience your product or service from their perspective.

**✅ Ideal for:** Communicating the customer journey and identifying pain points or opportunities

## Preparation

1. **Define the scenario** you want to illustrate
2. **Identify key moments** in the customer journey
3. **Sketch frames** showing each moment
4. **Add captions** explaining what's happening and how the customer feels

## Execution

1. **Share with team** for feedback
2. **Test with potential customers** to validate the journey resonates
3. **Iterate** based on feedback

## Analysis

- Does the story feel authentic to customers?
- Where do customers express most excitement or frustration?
- What moments are missing or feel forced?
- How does this inform your value proposition?

## Cost

💰 **Very Low** (1/5)

Just paper, pens, and time. Can be enhanced with digital tools if desired.

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | 1-3 hours |
| Testing | 1-2 days |

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Weak** (2/5)

Storyboards are primarily a communication and discovery tool. They help align teams and surface assumptions, but don't prove customer behavior.

## Skills Required

- Design / Product / Storytelling

You don't need to be an artist - stick figures work fine. The important skill is empathetic storytelling.

## Requirements

- Understanding of target customer
- Clear scenario to illustrate
- Willingness to iterate

## Frame Components

Each storyboard frame should include:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scene | What's happening visually |
| Caption | Narration or dialogue |
| Emotion | How the customer feels |
| Insight | What we learn from this moment |

## Storyboard Types

| Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Current State | Show existing pain points | Problem discovery |
| Future State | Show ideal experience | Vision alignment |
| Comparison | Before vs. After | Value demonstration |
| Journey Map | Full customer lifecycle | Strategic planning |

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Focus on customer's perspective, not product features
- Include emotional context
- Show realistic scenarios
- Keep it simple (6-12 frames)
- Test with real customers

### ❌ Don't:
- Make the product the hero (customer is the hero)
- Skip the problem setup
- Assume customers understand your solution
- Forget the "why" behind each moment
- Create in isolation
