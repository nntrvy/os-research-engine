# Referral Program

Chương trình giới thiệu

## Purpose

A method of promoting products or services to new customers through referrals, word of mouth, or through digital codes.

**✅ Ideal for:** Testing with customers how to scale your business organically

## Preparation

1. **Define conversion goal** for your referral program
2. **Identify advocates** who will send referral codes for you
3. **Create unique referral codes** for the program and integrate analytics

## Execution

1. Provide referral codes to your advocates
2. Run for several weeks so referred friends have time to consider and click

## Analysis

1. Calculate share rate from advocates
2. Calculate click-through rate from their friends
3. Calculate conversion rate of friends
4. Compare conversion rate with pre-defined goals
5. Use learnings to refine and A/B test your referral program

## Cost

💰 **Medium** (3/5)

- You'll need to incentivize customers (advocates) to refer for you, which incurs costs through discounts for both the advocate and the referred customer (friend)
- Low-cost software can help you manage referrals so you get analytics on how the program is working

## Time

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Setup | Short (configure referral codes, select advocates) |
| Running | Weeks to months |

You need time for advocates to refer and for their friends to decide whether to act on the referral.

## Evidence Strength

⚡ **Strong** (4/5)

### Advocates & Share Rate
- **Advocates:** Customers you provide referral codes to share
- **Shares:** Number of customers actively sharing the code with friends
- **Share Rate** = advocates who received code ÷ those who shared with friends
- **Target:** 15-20%

Advocates agreeing, accepting, and sharing a referral code is relatively strong evidence. They're taking action to refer your product to their friends.

### Friends, Clicks & Conversions
- **Friends:** People who receive the code from advocates
- **Click Rate from Friends** = friends who received code ÷ those who clicked on it
- **Target:** 50-80%

- **Conversion Rate from Friends** = people who clicked ÷ those who used code to sign up or purchase
- **Target:** 5-15%

Friends of advocates accepting the referral code and converting is strong evidence. They're acting on a referral for an offer, so it remains to be seen whether they'll stay long-term.

## Skills Required

- Design / Product / Marketing

Referral programs mostly require product and marketing capabilities. You need to clearly communicate why you're offering an incentive and how their friends will benefit from it.

You'll need design skills if using custom emails, social media posts, or landing pages dedicated to the program.

## Requirements

### Enthusiastic Customers
Initial customers often aren't immediately enthusiastic about your product. It takes time for them to become satisfied and develop into enthusiastic customers.

We recommend evaluating this before randomly sending referral codes. You'll want to send codes to people you think will actually refer their friends to your product and actively talk about it.
