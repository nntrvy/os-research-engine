# Customer Interviews Guide

A comprehensive guide for conducting customer insight interviews based on Strategyzer's methodology. Customer interviews are Experiment #04 in the experiments library and one of the most powerful tools for testing desirability hypotheses.

## The 8 Ground Rules for Interviewing

### Rule 1: Adopt a Beginner's Mind
Listen with "fresh ears" and avoid interpretation. Explore unexpected jobs, pains, and gains in particular. Don't assume you know what the customer will say.

### Rule 2: Listen More Than You Talk
Your goal is to **listen and learn**, not to inform, impress, or convince. Avoid wasting time talking about your own beliefs—it's at the expense of learning about your customer.

### Rule 3: Get Facts, Not Opinions
| Don't Ask | Do Ask |
|-----------|--------|
| "Would you...?" | "When is the last time you have...?" |
| "Do you think you would...?" | "Tell me about a time when..." |

### Rule 4: Ask "Why" to Get Real Motivations
- "Why do you need to do...?"
- "Why is ___ important to you?"
- "Why is ___ such a pain?"

### Rule 5: The Goal is Learning, Not Selling
| Don't Ask | Do Ask |
|-----------|--------|
| "Would you buy our solution?" | "What are your decision criteria when you make a purchase of...?" |

Even if a sale happens during the interview, your primary objective is gathering insights.

### Rule 6: Don't Mention Solutions Too Early
| Don't Say | Do Ask |
|-----------|--------|
| "Our solution does..." | "What are the most important things you are struggling with?" |

### Rule 7: Follow Up
Get permission to keep your interviewee's contact information to:
- Come back for more questions
- Test prototypes later
- Invite to beta programs

### Rule 8: Always Open Doors at the End
Always ask: **"Who else should I talk to?"**

This question generates warm referrals and expands your interview pool.

## Interview Questions by Topic

Your interview questions must always relate to one or several hypotheses underlying your Value Proposition Canvas.

**Important:** You cannot cover all six topics in one interview. Start with Customer Profile questions, then expand to Value Map questions once you understand your customers.

---

## Part 1: Customer Profile Questions

### 1. Customer Segmentation
Understand the demographics and context of your interviewee.

- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- What handles the process of [job-to-be-done] at home/office?
- How involved are you in the process of [job-to-be-done]?

### 2. Jobs, Pains & Gains Discovery

**Problems & Challenges:**
- What are your most significant problems? What happens when they occur?
- What's the hardest part of your day?
- What is the most frustrating thing about [your task, your role, your day]?
- What's the hardest thing when doing [activity related to fulfilling a job]?
- What are your current challenges at work/home? What tasks are creating serious headaches?

**Getting Specific:**
- When was the last time this happened? Can you tell me what happened in more detail?
- How often does this happen?

**Impact & Aspirations:**

**Ideal State:**

### 3. Intensity of Jobs, Pains & Gains

Not all jobs, pains, or gains are equally important. Identify which ones matter most.

**Ranking Questions:**
- Can you rank the issues you mentioned with the most critical ones at the top?
- On a scale of 1 (not important) to 10 (very important), how much would this problem score?
- What's a 10/10 problem?

**Willingness to Invest:**
- How much time per week are you willing to spend to find a solution for [problem/process] or fix it?
- What's the maximum you would pay if someone could instantly dissolve this pain/problem?

**Priority Question:**
- If you could solve only one problem at work/home, which one would you focus on?

---

## Part 2: Value Map Questions

### 4. Existing Solutions (What Works & What Doesn't)

Learn what customers love or hate about current solutions to design something superior.

**Current Usage:**

- On a scale of 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent), what grade would you give to this product? Why?

**Solution Search:**

**Experience:**

- What might improve your experience using the product?
- What motivates you to continue using this product?
- What's the hardest part about using this product?

### 5. Fit Between Customer Profile & Value Proposition

Co-create with customers and check if your value proposition addresses their needs.

**Ideal Solution:**
- What would an ideal solution do to solve your problem? What would it look like?
- What product do you wish you had that doesn't exist yet?
- What do you think could be done to help you with [pain/job]?

**Feature Prioritization:**
- Based on what you described as the ideal solution, could you help me rank the features according to their importance to you?
- Here is a set of 5 features: do you think they create value for you? How so? Can you rank them?

**Adoption:**
- Can you walk me through the process of acquiring, using and disposing this solution?

## Common Interview Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What To Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Asking "Would you buy...?" | Gets hypothetical opinions, not facts | Ask about past behavior and decisions |
| Pitching your solution | Biases responses, wastes learning time | Ask about their problems first |
| Asking leading questions | Confirms your bias, not reality | Use open-ended questions |
| Talking more than listening | Missing insights | Follow the 80/20 rule (listen 80%) |
| Not asking "why" | Getting surface answers | Dig deeper with follow-up "why" questions |
| Accepting vague answers | Can't act on general feedback | Ask for specific examples |
| Forgetting to ask for referrals | Limiting your interview pool | Always end with "Who else should I talk to?" |
