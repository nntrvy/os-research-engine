# Blue Ocean Playbook

A comprehensive guide to creating uncontested market space.

---

## The Theory

The business universe consists of two kinds of markets: **Red Ocean** and **Blue Ocean** — a concept pioneered by professors W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne.

### Red Ocean

Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today — the known market space.

- Industry boundaries are defined and accepted
- Competitive rules of the game are well understood
- Companies try to outperform rivals to grab greater share of existing demand
- As the space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth shrink
- Products turn into commodities
- Increasing competition turns the water bloody

### Blue Ocean

Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today — the unknown market space, untainted by competition.

- Demand is **created** rather than fought over
- Ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid
- Two ways to create blue oceans:
  1. **Create entirely new industries** (e.g., eBay with online auctions)
  2. **Alter boundaries of existing industries** (e.g., Cirque du Soleil combining circus with theater)

Based on a study of 30 industries, companies that create Blue Oceans reap the benefits for **10–15 years**, because it is hard for rivals to copy.

## So... Where Do We Swim?

Most startups enter red oceans — bloody waters full of competitors fighting over the same type of users with nearly identical solutions.

What happens?
- Price wars
- Feature wars
- Race-to-the-bottom energy

That's why about **90% of startups fail**.

**At OSR, we don't join fights. We find new games to play.**

We look for:
- Problems that are overlooked
- People no one is designing solutions for
- Spaces where we can rewrite the rules

That's the blue ocean — clear, open, full of possibility. Our best ideas don't compete — they change the game entirely.

## Value Innovation

The cornerstone of blue ocean strategy.

### The Core Principle

**Simultaneously pursue Differentiation AND Low Cost.**

This means breaking the trade-off between being different and being affordable. Instead of adding more features and raising costs like everyone else, we rethink what truly matters to users — and cut everything else.

We create more value for customers while keeping costs low by innovating the **entire business model**, not just the product.

### ⚠️ What Value Innovation Is NOT

| Bad Example | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| Cheap restaurants with bad service, delays, and hidden fees | Low cost + low quality |
| Budget hotel with stained sheets and fluorescent lighting | Race to the bottom |
| $5 earbuds that break in a week | No real value created |

**That's just low cost + low quality — a race to the bottom.**

## The 4-Actions Framework

**Objective:** Create new Value Propositions or Business Models, or improve existing ones.

This framework consists of four types of actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create** | Add new features or components the industry has never offered before |
| **Raise** | Strengthen existing features above industry standards |
| **Eliminate** | Remove factors the industry has taken for granted |
| **Reduce** | Scale back features below industry standards |

### Case Study: Nintendo Wii

How Nintendo disrupted the game console industry:

### Consequences on the Business Model

Compared to traditional gaming (PlayStation, Xbox at the time):

**Target Market Shift**
- From: Hardcore gamers (niche market)
- To: Casual gamers (much larger market)

**Technology Trade-off**
- Less powerful console, but more playful
- Caters to casual gamers who don't need cutting-edge specs

**Cost Structure Revolution**
- ↓ R&D costs significantly reduced
- ↓ Partnerships with technology suppliers (IBM) become irrelevant
- ↓ Work with off-the-shelf standard components
- ↓ Manufacturing costs drop dramatically
- ↓ Eliminated need for subsidies

**Revenue Model Transformation**
- ✓ Earn money on each console sold (vs. selling at a loss)
- ✓ Increased licensing revenue as sales volume explodes
- ✓ **Result: Insane profits**

## Blue Ocean Examples

| Company | Blue Ocean Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Cirque du Soleil** | Combined circus and theater to attract adult audiences willing to pay premium prices — without animals or big-name performers |
| **Nintendo Wii** | Targeted casual and non-gamers with motion-controlled fun instead of competing on graphics and hardware power |
| **Dyson** | Reinvented everyday appliances with engineering innovation and sleek design, making them aspirational tech products |
| **Tesla** | Entered auto industry through high-end EVs for luxury buyers, not mass-market eco-drivers, then scaled downward |
| **Apple** | Created seamless ecosystems of hardware, software, and services focused on design and user experience rather than specs or price wars |
| **CitizenM Hotels** | Cut unnecessary hotel luxuries (bellboys, restaurants) to offer stylish, tech-enabled stays at affordable prices for modern travelers |
| **The Body Shop** | Pioneered ethical beauty with natural ingredients, sustainability, and activism — long before it became mainstream |

## How to Apply This Framework

### Step 1: Map the Current Industry

Identify what factors the industry currently competes on:
- What do all players offer?
- What do customers expect as standard?
- Where is everyone spending money?

### Step 2: Question Everything

For each factor, ask:
- Is this actually valuable to customers, or just industry habit?
- Are we over-delivering on things customers don't care about?
- What pain points are everyone ignoring?

### Step 3: Apply the 4 Actions

Work through each quadrant:

1. **Eliminate**: What can we stop doing entirely?
2. **Reduce**: What can we dial back significantly?
3. **Raise**: What should we do far better than anyone?
4. **Create**: What should we introduce that's never been done?

### Step 4: Validate the New Curve

Your new value curve should:
- Diverge clearly from competitors
- Have a clear focus (not trying to do everything)
- Have a compelling tagline that captures the difference

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Incremental Thinking**
Don't just make something slightly better. That's red ocean thinking.

**2. Technology for Technology's Sake**
Blue oceans aren't about the latest tech. They're about solving real problems differently.

**3. Ignoring Cost Structure**
Value innovation requires BOTH differentiation AND low cost. If you're only doing one, you're missing the point.

**4. Copying Blue Oceans**
By definition, copying someone else's blue ocean puts you in their red ocean. Find your own waters.

**5. Forgetting the "Why"**
Every elimination and reduction should free up resources for what you're creating and raising.

## Conclusion

At OS Research, we're not here to make another app, another marketplace, or another startup that fades into noise.

**Life is too short for that shit.**

Our ambition is to create **50 blue oceans in this lifetime** — bold, unexpected, and deeply valuable ideas that reshape markets or create entirely new ones.

Every project we touch is a chance to:
- Swim into open waters
- Challenge assumptions
- Design something the world didn't see coming — but won't live without
