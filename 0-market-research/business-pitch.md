# Business Pitch Playbook

A step-by-step guide to creating your first business pitch report.

---

## Overview

Every new venture at OS Research begins with a structured Business Pitch — a comprehensive report that validates whether an idea is worth pursuing. This document combines market research, business design, and testable hypotheses into a single, actionable artifact.

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Market Research** | Understand the landscape | Market analysis report |
| **Business Design** | Design how we create value | VPC + BMC |
| **Hypotheses** | Define what we need to prove | 10 testable assumptions |

---

## Part 1: Market Research

Before designing anything, we must deeply understand the market we're entering.

### 1.1 Problem Definition

Start by articulating the problem clearly:

- **What is the problem?** (1-2 sentences)
- **Who experiences this problem?** (Be specific)
- **How severe is the problem?** (Frequency, intensity, willingness to pay)
- **How are people solving it today?** (Current alternatives)

### 1.2 Market Sizing

Estimate the opportunity using TAM-SAM-SOM:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 TAM                     │
│     Total Addressable Market            │
│     (Everyone who could use this)       │
│                                         │
│      ┌─────────────────────────┐        │
│      │          SAM            │        │
│      │  Serviceable Available  │        │
│      │  (Our target segment)   │        │
│      │                         │        │
│      │    ┌─────────────┐      │        │
│      │    │     SOM     │      │        │
│      │    │ Obtainable  │      │        │
│      │    │ (Year 1-2)  │      │        │
│      │    └─────────────┘      │        │
│      └─────────────────────────┘        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Calculate:**
- TAM: Total market value if 100% adoption
- SAM: Segment we can realistically target
- SOM: What we can capture in 1-2 years

### 1.3 Competitive Landscape

Map existing solutions:

| Competitor | What They Offer | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Direct 1   |                 |           |            |         |
| Direct 2   |                 |           |            |         |
| Indirect 1 |                 |           |            |         |
| DIY/Status Quo |             |           |            |         |

### 1.4 Customer Discovery

Interview at least 5-10 potential customers:

**Questions to ask:**
- Tell me about the last time you [experienced the problem]?
- What did you do? What solutions did you try?
- What was frustrating about that experience?
- How much time/money did it cost you?
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?

**Capture:**
- Direct quotes (verbatim)
- Behavioral patterns
- Emotional responses
- Willingness to pay signals

### 1.5 Market Research Summary

Compile findings into a 1-page summary:

```
MARKET RESEARCH SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem Statement:
[Clear, concise problem in 1-2 sentences]

Target Customer:
[Specific description of who we're serving]

Market Size:

• SOM: $___

Key Insights from Customer Discovery:
1. [Insight from interviews]
2. [Insight from interviews]
3. [Insight from interviews]

Competitive Gap:

## Part 2: Business Design

With market understanding in place, design the business using two canvases.

### 2.1 Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)

**Step 1: Complete the Customer Profile**

Map what you learned from market research:

| Component | Instructions | Examples |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Jobs** | Functional, social, emotional tasks | "Find reliable contractor" |
| **Pains** | Frustrations, risks, obstacles | "Don't know fair prices" |
| **Gains** | Desired outcomes, benefits | "Peace of mind" |

**Step 2: Complete the Value Map**

Design your response:

| Component | Instructions | Examples |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Products & Services** | What you offer | "Contractor matching platform" |
| **Pain Relievers** | How you address pains | "Price transparency tool" |
| **Gain Creators** | How you create gains | "Verified contractor network" |

**Step 3: Check for Fit**

Draw lines connecting:
- Each Pain Reliever → Specific Pain it addresses
- Each Gain Creator → Specific Gain it enables

If you can't draw clear lines, redesign.

### 2.2 Business Model Canvas (BMC)

Map all 9 building blocks of your business model.

```
┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐

│                │  KEY           │                │  CHANNELS      │                │

│                │                │                │                │                │
├────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┤
│                                        │                                           │
│  COST STRUCTURE                        │  REVENUE STREAMS                          │
│                                        │                                           │
└────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### BMC Building Blocks Guide

#### Right Side (Value & Customer)

| Block | Question | Writing Style |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Customer Segments** | Who are we creating value for? | Short, specific: "Urban homeowners, 30-45, first renovation" |
| **Value Propositions** | What value do we deliver? | Concise benefit: "Stress-free renovation with price guarantee" |
| **Channels** | How do we reach customers? | Specific touchpoints: "Instagram ads → Landing page → App" |
| **Customer Relationships** | What relationship do they expect? | Clear type: "Self-service + automated support + human escalation" |
| **Revenue Streams** | How do we capture value? | Pricing mechanism: "15% commission per completed project" |

#### Left Side (Infrastructure)

| Block | Question | Writing Style |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Key Resources** | What assets are essential? | Critical assets: "Contractor database, matching algorithm, trust score" |
| **Key Activities** | What must we do well? | Core actions: "Contractor vetting, quality control, dispute resolution" |
| **Key Partners** | Who helps us deliver? | Strategic allies: "Construction material suppliers, insurance providers" |
| **Cost Structure** | What are major costs? | Cost drivers: "Tech development, contractor acquisition, customer support" |

### Writing Guidelines for Sticky Notes

When filling in the BMC, each sticky note must be:

✅ **Short** — 3-7 words maximum
✅ **Specific** — No vague statements
✅ **Clear** — Anyone can understand it
✅ **Accurate** — Based on evidence, not wishful thinking

**Bad Examples:**
- ❌ "Make money" (too vague)
- ❌ "Digital marketing and various online and offline channels" (too long)
- ❌ "Users" (not specific)

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ "15% commission per project"
- ✅ "Instagram + Google Ads + Referrals"
- ✅ "Urban homeowners, first renovation"

## Part 3: 10 Hypotheses

Every business pitch is built on assumptions. We must identify and test the riskiest ones.

### 3.1 What is a Hypothesis?

A hypothesis is a testable assumption that, if proven wrong, would significantly impact the viability of the business.

**Format:**
> We believe [specific assumption].
> We will test this by [method].
> We are right if [measurable outcome].

### 3.2 The 10 Hypotheses Framework

Identify hypotheses across these categories:

#### Customer Hypotheses (2-3)

| # | Category | Example |
|---|----------|---------|
| H1 | **Customer exists** | "Urban homeowners struggle to find reliable contractors" |
| H2 | **Problem is painful** | "Homeowners spend 20+ hours researching before hiring" |
| H3 | **Willing to pay** | "Homeowners will pay 15% premium for guaranteed quality" |

#### Value Hypotheses (2-3)

| # | Category | Example |
|---|----------|---------|
| H4 | **Solution works** | "Our matching algorithm increases contractor satisfaction" |
| H5 | **Better than alternatives** | "Users prefer our platform over asking friends for referrals" |
| H6 | **Delivers promised value** | "Projects completed via platform have fewer disputes" |

#### Business Model Hypotheses (2-3)

| # | Category | Example |
|---|----------|---------|
| H7 | **Channel works** | "Instagram ads convert at 2%+ for homeowner acquisition" |
| H8 | **Unit economics work** | "CAC < $50, LTV > $150, payback < 6 months" |
| H9 | **Can scale** | "Contractor supply grows 20% MoM through referrals" |

#### Feasibility Hypotheses (1-2)

| # | Category | Example |
|---|----------|---------|
| H10 | **We can build it** | "MVP can launch in 8 weeks with $10K budget" |

### 3.3 Prioritizing Hypotheses

Rank hypotheses by:

1. **Risk Level** — How likely is this assumption to be wrong?
2. **Impact** — If wrong, does the business fail?
3. **Testability** — Can we test this quickly and cheaply?

**Priority Matrix:**

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                         │
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
         │               │               │
         │   TEST NOW    │   TEST NOW    │
         │   (Critical)  │   (Important) │
         │               │               │
HIGH ────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼──── LOW
RISK     │               │               │     RISK
         │   MONITOR     │   DEFER       │
         │               │               │
         │               │               │
         └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                         │
                    LOW IMPACT
```

### 3.4 Hypothesis Testing Plan

For each hypothesis, define:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hypothesis** | The assumption we're testing |
| **Test Method** | How we'll test (interview, landing page, prototype, etc.) |
| **Success Metric** | Quantifiable outcome that proves/disproves |
| **Timeline** | How long the test will run |
| **Resources** | What we need (budget, people, tools) |

**Example:**

```
HYPOTHESIS #3: Willingness to Pay
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Assumption: Homeowners will pay 15% commission for
            guaranteed quality and price protection

Test Method: Landing page with pricing, measure sign-up rate

Success Metric: >5% conversion rate on pricing page

Timeline: 2 weeks

Resources: $500 ad spend, landing page builder
```

- [ ] BMC is complete with all 9 blocks filled
- [ ] Sticky notes are short, specific, and evidence-based
- [ ] Revenue model is clearly defined

**Hypotheses**
- [ ] 10 hypotheses cover customer, value, business model, and feasibility
- [ ] Hypotheses are testable (not opinions)
- [ ] Success metrics are quantifiable
- [ ] Top 3 riskiest hypotheses have testing plans

## Timeline Template

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Problem & Customer Discovery | 5-10 interviews completed |
| 2 | Market Research | Market analysis summary |
| 3 | Business Design | VPC + BMC first draft |
| 4 | Hypotheses & Refinement | 10 hypotheses + testing plan |
| 5 | Pitch Assembly | Complete Business Pitch report |

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Skipping Customer Discovery**
Never design in a vacuum. Talk to real people first.

**2. Vague Hypotheses**
"People will like it" is not testable. Be specific.

**3. Overcomplicating the BMC**
Each sticky note should be 3-7 words. If you need more, you're not clear enough.

**4. Confirmation Bias**
Seek evidence that proves you wrong, not just right.

**5. Ignoring Competition**
"No competition" usually means no market or you haven't looked hard enough.

**6. Falling in Love with the Solution**
Stay attached to the problem, not your solution.

## Conclusion

The Business Pitch is not a plan — it's a set of hypotheses waiting to be tested.

Our goal is not to prove we're right. It's to learn as quickly as possible whether this idea is worth pursuing — and if not, to move on to the next opportunity.

> **Remember: A failed hypothesis is not a failure. It's learning. The only failure is not testing at all.**
