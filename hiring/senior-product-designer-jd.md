## The Role

You'll be the lead designer for 4 products — all AI-powered, all in active development:

A digital insurance platform for enterprise clients. Claims management, SLA tracking, workflow automation.
- Admin dashboards
- Mobile-responsive interfaces

- Conversation interfaces
- Progress tracking
- Audio/visual feedback systems

## What You'll Do

- Own the end-to-end design process: research, wireframes, UI, prototypes, handoff
- Create modern, visually pleasing interfaces that users actually enjoy
- Build and maintain design systems across multiple products
- Collaborate directly with founders and developers (no layers)
- Use AI tools to generate options fast, then refine with taste
- Run quick user tests and iterate based on real feedback

## You Should Be

**Strong in both UX and UI.** You can map complex user flows AND make them look beautiful. Not one or the other — both.

**AI-native.** You already use Figma AI, Midjourney, ChatGPT, Galileo, or similar tools daily. You have opinions about what works.

**Fast without sacrificing quality.** You compress 2-week cycles into days. You know when to polish and when to ship.

**Experienced with AI-powered products.** You've designed apps with AI features — chat interfaces, recommendations, voice, automation. You understand the UX patterns.

**Visually excellent.** Your portfolio makes people stop scrolling. Modern, clean, with attention to detail.

---

## Requirements

**Must have:**
- 4+ years of product design experience
- Portfolio showing both UX thinking and strong visual design
- Experience designing AI-powered or data-heavy applications
- Figma expert (components, auto-layout, prototyping, design systems)
- Fluent in English
- Currently using AI tools in your workflow

**Nice to have:**
- Experience with B2B SaaS, InsurTech, or AdTech
- Motion design / micro-interactions
- Can implement in Framer or Webflow
- Basic understanding of front-end development
