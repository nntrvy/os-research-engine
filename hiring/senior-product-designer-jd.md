## About OS Research

We're a startup studio on a mission to **create 50 blue oceans** — new market spaces where competition is irrelevant.

We use AI, structured experiments, and radical transparency to validate bold ideas faster than traditional studios. We share everything: our wins, our failures, our numbers.

**What we're building:**
- 🌊 **XanhSM Taxi Ads** — Programmatic advertising on 30K+ electric taxis
- 🐝 **bee-digital** — Insurance platform for Vietnam's largest conglomerate
- 🔬 **Validation Platform** — Our internal tool for running experiments (going public soon)

We're small, fast, and obsessed with design that actually works.

---

## The Role

We're looking for a **Senior Product Designer** who can own the design of multiple products — from our public-facing studio website to the internal tools we use to validate startups.

You'll be the design team. No layers. No approval chains. Just you, the founders, and real users.

**The twist:** We expect you to use AI to work at 2-3x the speed of a traditional designer. Figma AI, Midjourney, ChatGPT, Galileo, Framer AI — whatever makes you faster. We don't care how you get there, we care that you ship.

---

## What You'll Design

### 1. OS Research Studio Website
Our public face. Needs to feel like a studio that hunts blue oceans — bold, clear, a little unconventional.
- Landing pages
- Blog/content templates
- Case study pages
- Recruitment pages

### 2. Validation Platform (Internal → Public)
Our flagship tool for running startup experiments. Think Notion meets a science lab.
- Experiment tracking dashboards
- Hypothesis cards
- Evidence collection flows
- Analytics views

### 3. BeeOS & bee-digital
Enterprise software for insurance operations. Clean, efficient, no-nonsense.
- Admin dashboards
- Workflow screens
- Mobile-responsive views
- Design system maintenance

---

## What You'll Do

**Week to week:**
- Design new features end-to-end (research → wireframe → prototype → handoff)
- Maintain and evolve our design systems
- Run quick user tests (we'll help you find users)
- Ship designs to developers (we use Figma + clear specs)
- Use AI tools to generate options fast, then refine with taste

**What success looks like:**
- Features go from idea to shipped design in days, not weeks
- Developers rarely have questions because your specs are clear
- Users actually use what you design (we measure this)
- You've built a design system others can extend

---

## You Should Have

**Must have:**
- 4+ years of product design experience
- Strong portfolio showing end-to-end product work (not just pretty visuals)
- Figma proficiency (components, auto-layout, prototyping)
- Experience designing for web apps (dashboards, forms, data-heavy UIs)
- Fluent in English (we document everything in English)
- Already using AI tools to speed up your workflow

**Nice to have:**
- Experience with design systems at scale
- Basic HTML/CSS understanding (helps with handoff)
- Experience in B2B SaaS or enterprise software
- Motion design / micro-interactions
- Can do basic front-end implementation (Framer, Webflow)

---

## AI-Native Expectation

We're not looking for someone who "is open to learning AI tools."

We want someone who already uses them and has opinions about which ones work.

**Examples of what we expect:**
- Use Figma AI or Genius to generate layout options quickly
- Use Midjourney/DALL-E for placeholder imagery and visual exploration
- Use ChatGPT to write UX copy, generate user personas, or draft specs
- Use Galileo AI or similar to quickly prototype ideas
- Know when AI output is 80% there and needs human refinement

**The goal:** Compress a 2-week design cycle into 3-4 days without sacrificing quality.
