### 5.2 Data Requirements for Targeting

**Essential Data Inputs:**

1. **Location Intelligence:**
   - GPS data from taxi fleet (anonymized)
   - Route patterns, high-traffic corridors
   - Dwell time in specific zones (commercial, residential, entertainment)
   - Proximity to advertisers' physical locations

2. **Audience Data (Aggregated/Privacy-Compliant):**
   - Demographic profiles (age, gender, income estimates)
   - Trip patterns (commute vs. leisure, time-of-day)
   - Neighborhood characteristics (affluent vs. budget areas)
   - Rider frequency (loyal vs. occasional users)

3. **Contextual Data:**
   - Weather conditions (umbrella ads in rain, beverage ads in heat)
   - Time-of-day (breakfast brands in morning, entertainment at night)
   - Local events (concerts, sports, festivals)
   - Traffic density (real-time crowd concentration)

4. **Attribution Data:**
   - Device ID matching (anonymized mobile IDs)
   - Geo-fencing (track store visits post-exposure)
   - QR code scans, short link clicks
   - Cross-channel digital engagement (web visits, app downloads)

**Privacy Compliance:**

**Vietnam Personal Data Protection Decree (Effective July 1, 2023):**
- **Sensitive Data:** Includes **location data from location services** (broader than GDPR)
- **Requirements:** Specific notification for sensitive data processing, user consent
- **Implication:** GPS/location data must be **anonymized and aggregated** to avoid PII classification
- **Best Practice:** Truncate IP addresses, use geo-hashing, aggregate by zones (not individuals)

- One-to-many medium (groups, not individuals)
- Programmatic DOOH uses **anonymized data** + **contextual targeting**
- No third-party cookies required (future-proof for privacy regulations)

### 5.3 DSP/SSP Integration Requirements

**Technical Integration Steps:**

1. **SSP Selection:**
   - Choose platforms with proven DSP integrations (Vistar SSP, Hivestack SSP, VIOOH)
   - Evaluate analytics/reporting capabilities
   - Assess buyer network (GroupM, Dentsu access)

2. **Inventory Setup:**

   - Define screen specifications (resolution, loop length, aspect ratio)
   - Set availability windows, dayparting rules
   - Establish floor prices, yield optimization rules

3. **DSP Integrations:**
   - Each SSP must integrate with DSPs (expensive, technical expertise required)
   - Mediation platforms can aggregate multiple SSPs (reduces integration burden)
   - Test full purchase cycle: dayparting, loop lengths, screen volume, dynamic factors

4. **Creative Quality Assurance:**

## 7. Market Sizing Estimates

### 7.1 TAM (Total Addressable Market)

**Vietnam Total OOH + DOOH Market:**
- **2025:** $129.58M → **2030:** $171.29M (5.74% CAGR)

**Vietnam Digital Advertising:**
- **2025:** $1.446B → **2030:** $2.88B (14.38% CAGR)
- **Programmatic share by 2028:** 78% = ~$2.25B

**TAM = Vietnam DOOH Market (advertisers open to digital screens):**
- **2025:** ~$107.5M DOOH spend

### 7.2 SAM (Serviceable Available Market)

**Outdoor Roadside DOOH (Taxi-Relevant Segment):**
- 83.81% of OOH/DOOH revenue (2024) = roadside screens
- **SAM = Outdoor Roadside DOOH:** $107.5M × 83.81% = **~$90M (2025)**

**Retail & Consumer Goods (Primary Advertiser Segment):**
- 44.49% of OOH/DOOH = FMCG/retail
- **FMCG-Focused SAM:** $90M × 44.49% = **~$40M (2025)**

### 7.3 SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**XanhSM Fleet as % of Total Ride-Hailing:**
- XanhSM: 100,000 vehicles (cars + bikes)
- Total registered ride-hailing: 100,000+ (Ministry of Transport, end 2023)
- **Assumption:** ~150,000 total ride-hailing vehicles (2025, accounting for growth)
- **XanhSM share:** 100,000 / 150,000 = **66.7% of ride-hailing fleet**

**Traditional Taxis:**
- Vinasun: 5,000 (HCMC only)
- Mai Linh: Unknown, but nationwide
- **Total traditional taxis:** Est. 30,000-50,000 (declining market)

**Total Taxi/Ride-Hailing Inventory:**
- Est. 150,000 ride-hailing + 40,000 traditional = **190,000 vehicles**
- **XanhSM:** 100,000 / 190,000 = **52.6% of total taxi/ride-hailing inventory**

**SOM Calculation (Conservative):**

**Assumptions:**
1. Programmatic taxi ads capture **10-15%** of outdoor roadside DOOH by 2027 (3 years)
2. XanhSM exclusivity gives **60-80%** share of programmatic taxi ad market
3. Focus on FMCG/retail (44.49% of market)

**Scenario 1: Conservative (10% penetration, 60% share):**
- Outdoor Roadside DOOH 2027: $90M × 1.1^2 = **~$108M** (assuming 10% annual growth)
- Programmatic Taxi Ads: $108M × 10% = **$10.8M**
- XanhSM Share: $10.8M × 60% = **$6.5M SOM (2027)**

**Scenario 2: Moderate (12.5% penetration, 70% share):**
- Programmatic Taxi Ads: $108M × 12.5% = **$13.5M**
- XanhSM Share: $13.5M × 70% = **$9.5M SOM (2027)**

**Scenario 3: Aggressive (15% penetration, 80% share):**
- Programmatic Taxi Ads: $108M × 15% = **$16.2M**
- XanhSM Share: $16.2M × 80% = **$13M SOM (2027)**

**Year 1 (2026) SOM (Launching Phase):**
- Assume 20% of 2027 SOM captured in Year 1
- **Conservative:** $6.5M × 20% = **$1.3M**
- **Moderate:** $9.5M × 20% = **$1.9M**
- **Aggressive:** $13M × 20% = **$2.6M**

### 7.4 Revenue Model Assumptions

**Revenue Streams:**

1. **Advertising Inventory Sales:**
   - CPM (Cost Per Mille Impressions): $5-$15 (Vietnam DOOH benchmark)
   - Programmatic premium: +20-30% vs. static
   - Dynamic pricing (time-of-day, location, demand)

2. **Revenue Share with XanhSM:**
   - **Assumption:** 50/50 split (platform keeps 50%, XanhSM receives 50%)
   - Alternative: 60/40 (platform keeps 60%, XanhSM 40%)

3. **Data Licensing:**
   - Anonymized location intelligence sold to urban planners, retail analytics firms
   - Secondary revenue stream: Est. 5-10% of ad revenue

**Example Calculation (Year 1, Moderate Scenario):**
- **Gross Ad Revenue:** $1.9M
- **Platform Revenue (60/40):** $1.9M × 60% = **$1.14M**
- **XanhSM Revenue:** $1.9M × 40% = **$760K**
- **Data Licensing:** $1.9M × 7.5% = **$142.5K**
- **Total Platform Revenue:** $1.14M + $142.5K = **$1.28M (Year 1)**

**Break-Even Considerations:**
- Technology platform costs (SSP integration, CMS, servers): $200K-$400K (Year 1)
- Screen hardware (assume XanhSM provides, or amortize cost): $500K-$1M (100,000 screens × $5-$10 per screen)
- Operations (sales, ad ops, analytics): $300K-$500K (Year 1)
- **Total Costs Year 1:** $1M-$1.9M
- **Break-even:** Moderate-to-Aggressive scenario required

## 8. Strategic Recommendations

### 8.1 Blue Ocean Opportunities

**Four Actions Framework:**

| **ELIMINATE** | **REDUCE** |
|---------------|------------|
| Manual ad booking processes | Dependence on static billboard inventory |
| Static creative limitations | Broad, untargeted campaigns |
| Fragmented measurement (manual surveys) | Long lead times (campaign setup) |

| **RAISE** | **CREATE** |
|-----------|------------|
| Real-time targeting precision | Vietnam's first programmatic taxi ad platform |
| Measurement rigor (attribution, lift studies) | XanhSM exclusive partnership |
| Creative flexibility (DCO, dynamic content) | Privacy-compliant location intelligence marketplace |
| Advertiser ROI transparency | Omnichannel attribution (DOOH → digital) |

**Uncontested Market Space:**
- No verified programmatic taxi advertising competitor in Vietnam
- XanhSM's 100,000 fleet = largest DOOH taxi inventory in Southeast Asia
- Combine mobility (taxi ads) + programmatic targeting (JCDecaux level) + national reach (56 provinces)

### 8.2 Key Hypotheses to Test (Primary Research Required)

Following the "We believe that..." format from OS Research methodology:

**DESIRABILITY (Market Risk) — Test First:**

1. **We believe that** Vietnamese FMCG brands (Vinamilk, Masan, Unilever) will pay a 20-30% premium for programmatic taxi ads over static billboards due to measurable targeting and attribution.

2. **We believe that** media agencies (GroupM, Dentsu) will allocate 5-10% of DOOH budgets to programmatic taxi ads within 6 months of platform launch due to existing programmatic buying infrastructure.

3. **We believe that** advertisers prioritize real-time geo-targeting (proximity to stores, events) over broad reach when selecting DOOH inventory.

4. **We believe that** XanhSM riders (83% satisfaction, eco-conscious) represent a premium demographic that brands are willing to pay higher CPMs to reach.

**FEASIBILITY (Infrastructure Risk) — Test Second:**

5. **We believe that** XanhSM will agree to a 40/60 revenue share (XanhSM 40%, platform 60%) in exchange for exclusive programmatic advertising rights across their 100,000-vehicle fleet.

6. **We believe that** we can integrate with Vistar Media or Hivestack SSP and access 30+ DSPs (GroupM, Dentsu, The Trade Desk) within 3-6 months.

7. **We believe that** we can achieve Vietnam Personal Data Protection Decree compliance by anonymizing GPS data and using geo-hashing to aggregate location intelligence.

8. **We believe that** we can install and maintain digital screens on 10,000 XanhSM vehicles (10% of fleet) within 12 months with hardware costs under $500K.

**VIABILITY (Financial Risk) — Test Third:**

9. **We believe that** we can achieve $1.5M gross ad revenue in Year 1 by capturing 10% of outdoor roadside DOOH programmatic spend with 60% market share.

10. **We believe that** platform operational costs (technology, sales, ad ops) can remain under $1M in Year 1, achieving break-even by Month 18.

### 8.3 Competitive Advantages (Why This Can Win)

**1. Exclusive XanhSM Partnership:**
- Market leader (37.41% Q4 2024, surpassed Grab)
- 100,000 vehicle fleet = largest inventory
- 83% satisfaction = premium audience
- No existing ad program = greenfield opportunity

**2. First-Mover Advantage:**
- No verified programmatic taxi competitor in Vietnam
- JCDecaux/Chicilon focus on static/semi-outdoor (elevators, roadside LEDs)
- Shojiki/Taxi Advertising VN offer only analog/static taxi ads

**3. Proven Global Playbook:**
- NYC Screenverse + SOMO: 4,000 screens, 3B monthly impressions via Vistar/Hivestack
- Southeast Asia programmatic DOOH: 37% volume growth (2024 vs 2023)
- Technology platforms mature and accessible

**4. Strong Advertiser Demand:**
- FMCG/retail = 44.49% of OOH spend
- Programmatic = 78% of digital ad revenue by 2028
- JCDecaux 61.8% revenue uplift via VIOOH programmatic

**5. Measurable ROI:**
- Cross-channel attribution (geo-fencing, device ID matching)
- Brand/sales lift studies
- QR codes, short links, foot traffic analysis
- Addresses Vietnam's OOH measurement fragmentation

**6. Privacy-Compliant:**
- Anonymized GPS data (Vietnam Decree compliant)
- One-to-many medium (groups, not individuals)
- Future-proof (no third-party cookies)

**7. Premium Brand Alignment:**
- XanhSM's eco-friendly EVs + modern programmatic tech = cohesive story
- Appeals to sustainability-conscious advertisers (climate tech 22.3% of Vietnam VC in 2024)

### 8.4 Key Risks & Mitigation

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|----------------|
| **XanhSM declines partnership or demands unfavorable terms** | Validate willingness early (primary research), explore fallback partnerships (Grab, Be), start with pilot (1,000 vehicles) |
| **Advertiser adoption slower than projected** | Offer proof-of-concept campaigns with leading FMCG brands (Vinamilk, Masan), partner with GroupM/Dentsu for demand, aggressive CPM discounts in Year 1 |
| **Technology integration costs exceed budget** | Use mediation platforms (aggregate SSPs, reduce integration complexity), start with single SSP (Vistar or Hivestack), leverage open-source CMS (reduce costs) |
| **Regulatory restrictions on taxi screen advertising** | Validate legal framework early (Vietnam advertising law review), engage DOOH industry associations, ensure creative quality compliance |
| **Privacy concerns with GPS data** | Strict anonymization (geo-hashing, zone aggregation), transparency in data usage policies, third-party privacy audits |
| **Competitive response from JCDecaux/Chicilon** | First-mover advantage (exclusive XanhSM), differentiate on mobility (they focus on static locations), build advertiser loyalty via superior measurement |
| **Hardware/maintenance costs unsustainable** | Negotiate cost-sharing with XanhSM (they benefit from ad revenue), use durable, low-maintenance screens (e-paper, LED with 5+ year lifespan), start with smaller pilot fleet |
