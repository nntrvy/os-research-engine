## Key Assumptions Requiring Validation

Based on this secondary research, the following hypotheses require primary research validation:

### Desirability Hypotheses (Test First)

1. **We believe that** SMEs with $24B unmet financing needs will adopt alternative lending platforms if collateral requirements are reduced by 50% and approval times shortened to <48 hours.

2. **We believe that** rural households (63% of population with 65% internet penetration) will pay VND 50,000-100,000/month for offline-first EdTech solutions that work without consistent internet.

3. **We believe that** urban commuters in Hanoi/HCMC will switch to electric mobility options if total cost of ownership is within 10% of traditional motorbikes over 3 years.

4. **We believe that** 40% of the population without formal financial services will adopt microinsurance products priced at <VND 20,000/month with simplified claims processes.

5. **We believe that** informal workers (67% of workforce) will pay for portable social protection benefits they can carry across jobs and provinces.

### Feasibility Hypotheses (Test Second)

6. **We believe that** we can build a profitable SME lending platform with default rates <5% using alternative credit scoring (transaction data, e-commerce sales, utility payments) instead of traditional collateral.

7. **We believe that** we can deliver quality telemedicine services to rural areas (63% population) with acceptable diagnostic accuracy (>85%) using basic smartphone cameras and 3G connectivity.

8. **We believe that** we can create an EdTech platform that works offline and syncs with <1MB daily data usage to serve the 18% of poorest children with home internet.

### Viability Hypotheses (Test Third)

9. **We believe that** a microinsurance product for informal workers can achieve unit economics of <VND 15,000 customer acquisition cost with >60% annual retention to reach profitability within 24 months.

10. **We believe that** an urban air quality monitoring + smart commuting app can monetize through B2B2C partnerships (insurance discounts, government contracts) and reach 100,000 users within 12 months in Hanoi/HCMC.

## Data Limitations & Gaps

### Recency Concerns
- Some insurance data from 2021-2023 (approaching 12-month limit)
- Urbanization statistics may not reflect latest 2025 migration patterns
- SME financing gap estimates based on pre-2025 data

### Missing Data
- Granular breakdown of insurance penetration by income segment
- Specific cost comparisons: public vs. private healthcare
- SME default rates by sector and size
- Rural vs. urban willingness-to-pay for digital services
- Actual EdTech adoption rates in public schools (beyond infrastructure stats)

### Data Quality Issues
- Life insurance market showing conflicting growth projections
- NPL figures may underreport due to forbearance policies
- Informal economy data inherently difficult to measure accurately

### Primary Research Required
- Customer interviews with SME owners on financing alternatives
- Ethnographic research in rural areas on healthcare/education workarounds
- Willingness-to-pay surveys for insurance/financial products
- User testing of digital-first solutions with low-income segments
- Deep-dive case studies of successful vs. failed EdTech implementations
