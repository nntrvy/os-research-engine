## EXPERIMENT Quadrant (Important + No Evidence)

### Hypothesis #1: Advertiser Budget Commitment

**Statement:**
> We believe that FMCG/retail brands currently spending on OOH advertising will allocate at least 10% of their quarterly outdoor budget ($50K+ minimum) to a 3-month programmatic taxi screen pilot within 30 days of sales outreach.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Desirability (Market Risk) |
| **Priority** | EXPERIMENT — Test Immediately |
| **Why Critical** | Directly tests willingness to pay and budget allocation behavior |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Sales pitch test with 10 target brands |
| **Success Criteria** | 30%+ convert to signed pilot with $50K+ budget |

---

### Hypothesis #2: Feature Priority — Real-Time Data

**Statement:**
> We believe that 70% of media buyers at the top 5 advertising agencies (GroupM, Dentsu, Publicis, Omnicom, IPG) will rank "real-time campaign performance data and impression verification" as their #1 must-have feature when evaluating our platform versus traditional taxi advertising.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Desirability (Market Risk) |
| **Priority** | EXPERIMENT — Test Immediately |
| **Why Critical** | Validates whether measurement/ROI pain points translate into purchase criteria |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Problem interview with 15 agency media buyers |
| **Success Criteria** | ≥70% rank it #1, or ≥85% rank it in top 2 |

---

### Hypothesis #3: XanhSM Partnership Terms

**Statement:**
> We believe that XanhSM will grant exclusive rights to install 10.1" Android tablets with 4G connectivity on 1,000 taxis within 90 days of partnership agreement signing, with hardware installation costs not exceeding $200 per vehicle.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Feasibility (Infrastructure Risk) |
| **Priority** | EXPERIMENT — Test Immediately |
| **Why Critical** | Tests the core infrastructure assumption — can we deploy at scale |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Partnership negotiation, secure LOI |
| **Success Criteria** | LOI with 1,000 taxi commitment, ≤$200/vehicle, <90-day timeline |

---

### Hypothesis #4: CPM Pricing Premium

**Statement:**
> We believe that advertisers will pay a CPM of $8-12 for geo-targeted, programmatic taxi screen ads—representing a 30-50% premium over static billboard CPMs—when shown proof of verified impressions and audience targeting capabilities.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Desirability (Market Risk) |
| **Priority** | EXPERIMENT — Test Immediately |
| **Why Critical** | Tests pricing hypothesis and whether measurement/targeting justify premium |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Pricing survey with 20 OOH advertisers |
| **Success Criteria** | 60%+ willing to pay $8-12 CPM when shown measurement features |

---

### Hypothesis #5: DSP Integration Feasibility

**Statement:**
> We believe that integrating with at least 2 major DSPs (The Trade Desk, Google DV360) will enable 80% of target advertisers to execute campaigns through their existing programmatic buying workflows within 6 months of platform launch.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Feasibility (Infrastructure Risk) |
| **Priority** | EXPERIMENT — Test Immediately |
| **Why Critical** | Tests technical integration feasibility for "programmatic" promise |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Technical validation sprint with SSP providers |
| **Success Criteria** | Both integrations feasible within 90 days, support core features |

---

## SHARE Quadrant (Important + Have Evidence)

### Hypothesis #6: Dynamic Creative Engagement

**Statement:**
> We believe that brands running location-based campaigns (QSR, retail stores, automotive dealerships) will generate 2.5x higher engagement rates with dynamic creative that changes based on proximity to store locations compared to static creative.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Desirability (Market Risk) |
| **Priority** | SHARE — Validate Evidence |
| **Existing Evidence** | JCDecaux 61.8% revenue uplift, global data-driven campaigns show 40% stronger lift |
| **Why Important** | Justifies dynamic creative investment |
| **Suggested Experiment** | A/B test with 3 pilot brands |
| **Success Criteria** | ≥2x engagement rate for dynamic vs static |

---

### Hypothesis #7: Year 2 Revenue Model

**Statement:**
> We believe that achieving 5% penetration of Vietnam's 100,000 taxi fleet (5,000 screens) by Year 2 will generate $3.8M in gross advertising revenue based on 4 ad spots/hour, 12 operating hours/day, and $10 CPM.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Viability (Financial Risk) |
| **Priority** | SHARE — Validate Evidence |
| **Existing Evidence** | Financial model built on global benchmarks |
| **Why Important** | Core business case depends on revenue model accuracy |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Live inventory test with first 100 screens |
| **Success Criteria** | Actual metrics validate model assumptions (fill rate, CPM, impressions/hour) |

---

## DEFER Quadrant (Unimportant + No Evidence)

### Hypothesis #8: Screen Uptime

**Statement:**
> We believe that screen uptime will exceed 92% across the taxi fleet when using cellular connectivity (4G/5G) for content delivery and real-time bidding, with less than 5% of impressions lost due to technical failures.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Feasibility (Infrastructure Risk) |
| **Priority** | DEFER — Address Later |
| **Why Deferrable** | Important for quality but not a deal-breaker for initial pilots |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Technical pilot with 50 screens over 60 days |
| **Success Criteria** | ≥92% uptime, <5% failed impressions |

---

### Hypothesis #9: Driver Incentive Economics

**Statement:**
> We believe that driver incentive costs (paying drivers for carrying screens) will not exceed 15% of gross advertising revenue when offering drivers 500,000 VND/month per vehicle ($20 USD).

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Viability (Financial Risk) |
| **Priority** | DEFER — Address Later |
| **Why Deferrable** | Affects unit economics but can optimize after proving advertiser demand |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Driver compensation survey with 100 XanhSM drivers |
| **Success Criteria** | Drivers accept ≤500K VND/month |

---

## MONITOR Quadrant (Unimportant + Have Evidence)

### Hypothesis #10: Omnichannel Attribution Adoption

**Statement:**
> We believe that 40% of advertisers running taxi screen campaigns will expand to omnichannel attribution (linking taxi ad exposure to mobile app installs or website visits) within 6 months of their first campaign.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Desirability (Market Risk) |
| **Priority** | MONITOR — Keep on Radar |
| **Existing Evidence** | Global DOOH trends support this |
| **Why Lower Priority** | Nice-to-have feature, not critical for initial PMF |
| **Suggested Experiment** | Feature adoption tracking post-launch |
| **Success Criteria** | ≥40% request attribution integration |

## Testing Priority Order

### Week 1-4: Core Viability

| Order | Hypothesis | Why First |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | #1 (Budget Commitment) | Proves commercial demand exists |
| 2 | #3 (XanhSM Partnership) | Proves infrastructure is accessible |
| 3 | #4 (CPM Pricing) | Proves pricing model can support business |

### Week 5-8: Product Requirements

| Order | Hypothesis | Why Second |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 4 | #2 (Feature Priorities) | Refines product roadmap |
| 5 | #5 (DSP Integration) | Validates technical feasibility |

### Post-Launch: Optimization

| Order | Hypothesis | Why Later |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| 6 | #6 (Dynamic Creative) | Proves premium feature value |
| 7 | #7 (Revenue Model) | Validates at-scale economics |
| 8-10 | #8, #9, #10 | Operational optimization |

---

## Decision Gates

| After Testing | If Invalidated | Pivot To |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| #1 (Budget) | <30% commit | Lower pilot price, smaller scope |
| #3 (XanhSM) | No LOI | Approach Grab or Be as alternative |
| #4 (CPM) | Only $5-6 CPM accepted | Volume play, 2,000+ taxis |
| #5 (DSP) | >6 months needed | Self-serve dashboard first, delay programmatic |
