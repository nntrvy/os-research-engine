### Pains

#### Major Pain Points (High Severity)

**1. Inability to Measure ROI**
- "For decades, OOH advertising was seen as highly impactful but notoriously difficult to measure"
- "Unlike digital marketing, outdoor advertising doesn't provide accurate impressions or conversions"
- "It can be difficult to directly tie screen exposure to sales or conversions"
- **Impact:** 52% of marketers concerned about measurement post-cookie deprecation

**2. No Targeting Capabilities**
- Traditional billboards reach everyone indiscriminately, leading to wasted impressions
- Cannot adjust messaging based on audience demographics or time of day
- "One major stumbling block has been that it's difficult to track. You have to trust that your campaign is working"

**3. High Costs with Uncertain Returns**
- Vietnam billboard rental: "few tens of millions to hundreds of millions, even billions of dong depending on location"
- "Outdoor billboards are defaulted as expensive media and seem to be available only to large businesses"
- "Need to budget for 3-5 billboards in a campaign" for effectiveness

**4. Long-Term Commitments Required**
- "Clients are reluctant to commit to long-term contracts"
- Traditional OOH dominated by "consumer goods brands running short-term sales campaigns"
- Cannot quickly adjust or cancel campaigns

**5. Economic Downturn Pressures**
- Vietnam outdoor advertising "revenue plummeted by 40% year on year" (2014)
- "Vacancy rate of billboards remains high"
- "Brands continue to limit their advertising budget"

#### Moderate Pain Points

**6. Attribution Complexity**
- "Connecting offline exposure to online conversions remains complex"
- "Double-counting issues" when consumers see multiple touchpoints
- Regional data gaps outside major urban centers

**7. Lack of Standardization**
- "Different providers use different methodologies to calculate impressions"
- "Without consistent frameworks, comparing results across platforms is difficult"

**8. Limited Engagement Time**
- "On average, each person only has 5-7 seconds to see, read and remember outdoor billboards"
- Static creative cannot adapt to context (weather, traffic, events)

**9. Privacy Compliance Concerns**
- "8 new U.S. state privacy laws will take effect in 2025"
- Advertisers must navigate GDPR, CCPA while using location/behavioral data

**10. Resource-Intensive Campaign Setup**
- "Marketing agencies need to do specific research on billboard location appropriateness"
- "This process will consume a lot of resources if deployed by in-house Marketing team"

## Current Workarounds

### What Advertisers Currently Do

**1. Combine OOH with Digital Tracking Tools**
- Use unique promo codes, QR codes, custom URLs (UTM-tagged)
- Deploy geofencing to track foot traffic near billboards
- Run brand lift surveys to measure awareness
- **Pain:** Still estimates, not precise attribution

**2. Shift Budget to Fully Digital Channels**
- Move spend to Facebook, Google Ads where tracking is easier
- Sacrifice OOH's high visibility and brand-building power
- **Pain:** Miss out on unmissable, ad-block proof formats

**3. Hire Specialized Agencies**
- Outsource OOH research and placement to agencies
- Rely on agency reports (often outdated)
- **Pain:** Higher costs, less control, delayed insights

**4. Use Traditional Taxi Advertising**
- Static decals on taxi doors, windows, interiors
- Print tore (flyers) on seatbacks
- **Pain:** No dynamic content, no targeting, no measurement

**5. Focus Only on Premium Billboards**
- Select 1-2 high-traffic locations vs. broader coverage
- Accept high CPMs for "guaranteed" visibility
- **Pain:** Limited reach, still no proof of effectiveness

**6. Accept OOH as "Brand Building Only"**
- Don't attempt to measure direct response
- Justify spend based on impressions/traffic estimates alone
- **Pain:** Can't prove ROI to CFOs/stakeholders

### On Vietnam Market Conditions
> "Revenue from billboards plummeted by 40% year on year in the first half of 2014, prompting site owners to slash their fees to attract custom."

> "Many riverside billboards, once considered to be Ho Chi Minh City's prime outdoor advertising sites, had been empty for the past year."
