# CON SẼ LỚN KHÔN - Child Development Platform for Special Needs Children in Vietnam

**Research Date:** February 1, 2026
**Researcher:** OSR-Researcher
**Business Concept:** AI-powered child development platform targeting children ages 2-10 with developmental disorders (autism, ADHD, developmental delays) and their caregivers in Vietnam

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

- **Market Size:** Vietnam has ~1 million people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with prevalence increasing from 0.75% (1 in 132) to recent provincial rates of 2.0% (1 in 50). ADHD affects 3.2-9.3% of Vietnamese children, with 7.7% in primary school studies.
- **Massive Financial Burden:** Families spend 5.5-8.5M VND/month (~$220-340 USD) on intervention centers plus 3M VND (~$120 USD) for 1-on-1 therapy, totaling 8.5-11.5M VND/month (~$340-460 USD). Some families report burning 20M VND/month (~$800 USD).
- **Critical Gap:** No health insurance coverage for autism/ADHD services in Vietnam despite 90% national coverage, forcing out-of-pocket payments. Early intervention centers have limited capacity and are concentrated in Hanoi/HCMC.
- **Digital Opportunity:** Smartphone penetration at 78.8% (79.8M users), with 76.2M social media users. Middle class projected to reach 55% by 2030, with disposable income rising 4.8% annually.
- **Parent Desperation:** Social listening reveals extreme emotional distress, financial exhaustion, school rejection trauma, and desperate need for affordable home intervention guidance.

### Strategic Recommendation

**Blue Ocean Space Identified:** Affordable, AI-guided home intervention platform that democratizes access to evidence-based therapy, avoiding the "center or nothing" dichotomy. Target non-customers: rural families, lower middle class, and families on waitlists for intervention centers.

### 2.2 Pains (Ranked by Intensity)

**Critical Pains:**

1. **Financial Exhaustion** (Most Severe)
   - "Đốt 50tr/tháng chi phí gia đình" (Burning 50M VND/month for family costs - 2 children)
   - "20tr/tháng cho can thiệp" (20M VND/month for intervention)
   - "5.5-8.5 triệu/tháng học phí + 3 triệu can thiệp" (5.5-8.5M tuition + 3M intervention)
   - "Nợ đầm đìa cả tỷ rồi nhưng mà tôi kệ mẹ, con tôi tôi cứu" (Drowning in billions VND debt but I don't care, I'll save my child)
   - **Quote:** *"Chán nản quá tôi mở mẹ trung tâm, thuê giáo viên can thiệp luôn"* (So frustrated I opened my own center and hired intervention teachers)

2. **School Rejection Trauma**
   - "Đi đâu người ta cũng chối" (Everywhere rejects us)
   - "Vào trường đắt nhất ở địa phương, họ chối thẳng" (Applied to most expensive school in town, they rejected us outright)
   - "Có PH bị đuổi gần 10 trường vẫn kiên trì" (Some parents got kicked out of nearly 10 schools but persisted)
   - Parents forced to "đấm tiền đầy mồm cô" (stuff teachers' mouths with money) to get acceptance

3. **Information Asymmetry & Distrust**
   - "Mấy bà cô dạy can thiệp hái ra tiền, một đứa nhận 3 củ" (Intervention teachers are raking in money, 3M per child)
   - "Dạy ko hiệu quả mấy... Càng về sau trẻ càng tụt lùi đi" (Teaching not very effective... Later on children regress more)
   - "Chỉ đc mấy tháng đầu chưa biết thì biết hơn... Càng về sau thì trẻ càng tụt lùi" (Only effective first few months when they didn't know things... Later they regress)
   - Parents desperate for objective progress tracking

4. **Sleep Deprivation & Behavioral Crisis**
   - "10-11h mới ngủ là sớm, có khi 11-12h... Tầm 1-2h sáng là tỉnh rồi bắt đầu đập chân... 3-4h sáng mệt quá mới ngủ" (Sleep at 10-11pm if early, sometimes 11-12pm... Wake at 1-2am and start kicking feet... Exhausted at 3-4am then sleep)
   - "La hét um xùm, quơ quào tùm lum, ở nhà thì ảnh hưởng hàng xóm khiếu nại" (Screaming and flailing, at home neighbors complain)
   - "8 tuổi rồi mà ko biết nói, ko tự vệ cá nhân được và chị xác định phải chăm nó cả đời" (8 years old, can't talk, can't self-care, sister has accepted lifelong caregiving)

5. **Delayed Diagnosis & Wasted Time**
   - "3 tuổi con mình mới mở miệng nói câu đầu tiên là: mẹ ơi" (My child only opened mouth to say first sentence at 3 years old: "Mom")
   - "4 tuổi rưỡi... Nói được câu tầm 5,6 từ nhưng ko lưu loát (tương đương trẻ 3 tuổi)" (4.5 years old... Can say sentences of 5-6 words but not fluent, equivalent to 3-year-old)
   - "16m mà ko nói đc từ đơn là cho đi khám đc r" (If 16 months and can't say single words, can go for checkup already)
   - Parents realize too late that "3 tháng biết rồi" (can detect at 3 months) per international research

### 2.3 Gains (What Success Looks Like)

**Realized Gains from Intervention:**
- "32 tháng giờ đang học can thiệp... Các cô ở trung tâm bảo tiếp thu nhanh lắm chỉ cái gì 1 lần là biết" (32 months now in intervention... Teachers say absorbs very fast, learns things in one go)
- "Giờ 3 tuổi đã nói được nhiều hơn, chơi được với nhiều bạn" (Now 3 years old, can speak more, can play with many friends)
- "77.5% of children showed improvement" from A365.vn intervention videos (2016 data)
- Child reaching point where "đọc viết ổn cô cũng đỡ la mắng" (reading/writing okay so teachers scold less)

**Desired Gains:**
- Child can integrate into mainstream school (ultimate goal)
- Daily activities become manageable without constant screaming/tantrums
- Child learns to communicate needs verbally instead of pointing/crying
- Family can go to public places without constant stress
- Confidence that "lớn lên bé sẽ hết thôi" (when they grow up they'll be better)

### 2.4 Workarounds (Current Coping Strategies)

**Financial Workarounds:**
- "Bán căn cc đang ở (Tương đối rộng) để chuyển xuống căn nhỏ hơn, giá rẻ hơn" (Sell current relatively large apartment to move to smaller, cheaper one)
- Parent quits job entirely to do full-time intervention and transport
- Opening own intervention center after getting frustrated with existing options
- "Đấm tiền đầy mồm cô" (Bribing teachers with extra cash to accept child)

**Educational Workarounds:**
- "Tìm trường dạng doanh nghiệp lớn là được... họ thuê hiệu trưởng, đè đầu chỉ tiêu nên nhận hết" (Find large enterprise-run schools... they hire principals and push enrollment quotas so they accept everyone)
- Persistence: "Đuổi trường này, học trường khác, có PH bị đuổi gần 10 trường vẫn kiên trì" (Kicked from this school, try another school, some parents kicked from nearly 10 schools but persisted)
- Paying 1M VND/teacher/month in "gifts" to ensure proper care

**Home Intervention Workarounds:**
- "Mua mấy cái miếng dán con vật... dán khắp nhà, rồi chỉ cho con biết" (Buy animal stickers... stick all over house, then point and teach child)
- "Cho bé ra ngoài nhiều, dẫn bé tới nơi này nơi kia" (Take child outside often, lead them to various places)
- Mother does evening reinforcement after center classes
- Using TV/phone as "công cụ duy nhất có thể giữ bé ngồi yên" (only tool that can keep child sitting still) despite knowing it's harmful

**Information Seeking:**
- Scraping Voz forums for parent experiences and recommendations
- Testing child with free A365.vn screening tools at 18 months

- International apps charge $60-230 USD annually (equivalent to 1-4M VND)

**Gap 3: Home-to-Center Bridge**

**Legend:**
- ● = Physical Centers (high price, low accessibility)
- ● = A365.vn (free, limited features)
- ○ = CON SẼ LỚN KHÔN (balanced value curve)

### 6.4 Non-Customer Analysis

**Tier 1: Soon-to-be Non-Customers** (On the edge of market)
- Middle-class families who can't afford 8.5M/month centers
- Rural families near cities with smartphone access
- Parents on waitlists (6-12 months) desperate for immediate action
- **Size:** ~50,000 families
- **Win Condition:** Affordable pricing + proven effectiveness

- Lower middle class who view centers as "luxury for rich people"
- Parents who distrust intervention industry ("cô giáo hái ra tiền")
- Families who tried A365.vn but found it too passive/outdated
- **Size:** ~100,000 families
- **Win Condition:** Transparent outcomes + AI credibility + community proof

**Tier 3: Unexplored Non-Customers** (Far from market)
- Rural families with undiagnosed children (stigma prevents seeking help)
- Grandparents as primary caregivers (low digital literacy)
- Lower-income families who view intervention as impossible
- **Size:** ~300,000 families
- **Win Condition:** Free tier + Vietnamese UI + voice-first interaction + offline mode

- **Simplified interaction:** 10-15 min daily activities (like Wii's motion controls vs. complex controllers)
- **Family involvement:** Parents become co-therapists (like Wii bringing families together)

**Similar to Southwest Airlines:**
- **Eliminate luxury:** No fancy facilities, just effectiveness (like Southwest eliminating meals/seat selection)
- **Reduce cost:** 85-90% cheaper than centers (like Southwest vs. major airlines)
- **Frequent touchpoints:** Daily home sessions (like Southwest's point-to-point model)

**Similar to Curves Fitness:**
- **Target underserved segment:** Lower middle class parents (like women intimidated by gyms)
- **Simplified program:** 10-15 min circuits (like Curves' 30-min circuit)

## 9. Regulatory & Legal Considerations

### 9.1 Data Privacy & Child Protection

**Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) - Effective January 1, 2026**
- **Source:** [EY Vietnam Legal Alert](https://www.ey.com/en_vn/technical/tax/tax-and-law-updates/legal-alert-july-2025-personal-data-protection-law)
- **Decree 356/2025/ND-CP** - Implementing regulations (effective Jan 1, 2026)

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Consent for Health Data Processing**
   - Health-related data requires **explicit consent** (PDPL Article on enhanced protection)
   - No third-party sharing unless user consents
   - Must fully comply with data protection laws

2. **Children's Data (Special Protections)**
   - For children aged **7+ years:** Require consent from **both child AND legal representative** for disclosing private life information
   - For children under 7: Legal representative consent only
   - **Critical:** Data processing must stop if consent withdrawn or authorities find risks to children's rights
   - Source: [CookieScript Vietnam PDPL Guide](https://cookie-script.com/privacy-laws/vietnam-personal-data-protection-law)

3. **Implementation Requirements**
   - **Data localization:** Unclear if health data must be stored in Vietnam (provision "not really complete" per sources)
   - **Parental controls:** Platform must allow parents to export, delete, or modify child's data
   - **Breach notification:** Must notify authorities + users within 72 hours of data breach

**Platform Implications:**
- ✅ Obtain dual consent (parent + child 7+) for video uploads
- ✅ Implement data export tools (GDPR-style "right to access")
- ✅ Store videos with end-to-end encryption
- ✅ Partner with Vietnamese cloud provider (Viettel, VNPT) for data localization compliance
- ⚠️ Consult legal counsel on whether AI training constitutes "third-party processing"

### 9.2 Medical Device Classification

**Decree 98/2021/ND-CP - Management of Medical Equipment**
- **Source:** [Asia Actual Vietnam Medical Device Registration](https://asiaactual.com/vietnam/medical-device-registration/)
- **Circular No. 05/2022/TT-BYT** - Classification rules (16 rules aligned with ASEAN Medical Device Directive)

**Classification Criteria:**
- Software is considered a **medical device** under new rules
- 4 classes: A (low risk) → D (high risk)
- Classification based on **intended use** and **risk level**

**Platform Analysis:**

**If positioned as "Educational/Wellness App":**
- **Not a medical device** if marketed for "child development support" without diagnostic/treatment claims
- No Ministry of Health registration required
- Similar to general education apps

**If positioned as "Intervention Tool":**
- **Likely Class A or B** (low-medium risk)
- Class A: Declaration to local Department of Health
- Class B: Declaration to local Department of Health (simpler than Class C/D)
- Does NOT require clinical trials for Class A/B

**Recommended Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1 (Year 1-2):** Launch as "educational support platform" to avoid registration delays
   - Marketing language: "Developmental activities for parents" NOT "autism treatment"
   - Disclaimer: "Not a substitute for professional medical advice"
   - No diagnostic claims (e.g., don't say "diagnoses autism")

2. **Phase 2 (Year 3+):** Pursue Class A/B medical device registration
   - Enables partnerships with hospitals (referral pathway)
   - Allows insurance coverage claims
   - Provides competitive moat (regulatory approval = trust signal)

3. **Partnership Workaround:**
   - Collaborate with National Children's Hospital (licensed institution)
   - Platform operates under their "supervision" (similar to A365.vn + CCHIP model)
   - Avoids individual device registration complexity

**Sources:**
- [Emergo by UL - Vietnam Medical Device Registration](https://www.emergobyul.com/services/medical-device-and-ivd-registration-and-approval-vietnam)
- [Artixio Vietnam Regulations](https://www.artixio.com/post/vietnam-regulations-for-registration-of-medical-device)

### 9.3 Professional Licensing (Therapist Marketplace)

**Concern:** Are platform-facilitated consultations subject to telemedicine regulations?

**Vietnam Telemedicine Framework:**
- **Circular 49/2017/TT-BYT** - Guidance on telemedicine (outdated, pre-COVID)
- **Decree 151/2013/ND-CP** - Only licensed medical facilities can provide telemedicine

**Platform Positioning:**
- **NOT telemedicine:** Therapists provide "coaching" not "medical diagnosis"
- **Marketplace model:** Platform connects parents with independent contractors (like Grab connects drivers)
- **Therapist responsibility:** Each therapist operates under own professional license
- **Platform role:** Technology provider only, not healthcare provider

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Require therapists to show valid license (SLP, BCBA, OT certification)
- Disclaimers: "Educational consultation, not medical diagnosis"
- Terms of Service: Parents acknowledge consultation is not substitute for in-person evaluation
- Avoid hosting in Vietnam: Use international video platform (Zoom, Google Meet) to avoid telehealth jurisdiction

### 9.4 Content & Advertising Regulations

**Decree 15/2020/ND-CP - Advertising**
- Healthcare advertising requires Ministry of Health approval
- Cannot make unverified health claims

**Platform Compliance:**
- ❌ Avoid: "Cures autism" or "Guaranteed results"
- ✅ Use: "78% of families reported improvement" (with study citation)
- ✅ Include disclaimers: "Results may vary, consult your pediatrician"

**Influencer Partnerships:**
- Must disclose paid partnerships (#quảngcáo hashtag)
- Cannot feature doctors making medical claims without approval

### 9.5 Intellectual Property

**Content Licensing:**
- Platform must license international curricula (ESDM, ABA)
- Fair use exemption for educational purposes (limited)
- Translation of research papers: Obtain permission or use Creative Commons sources

**Trademark:**
- Register "CON SẼ LỚN KHÔN" with National Office of Intellectual Property (NOIP)
- Estimated cost: 5-10M VND + legal fees

**Platform IP:**
- AI models: Proprietary, keep confidential
- Video content: Copyright owned by platform
- User-generated content: License from parents in Terms of Service

## 10. Hypotheses for Validation

Based on this research, the following are the **10 most critical hypotheses** to test, ranked using the Assumptions Map framework (Importance × Evidence).

### 10.1 EXPERIMENT Quadrant (Important + No Evidence)
**Test these FIRST - highest risk, highest impact**

#### Hypothesis 1: Willingness to Pay (CRITICAL)
**Positive:** We believe that urban middle-class parents in Hanoi/HCMC WILL pay 500K-1M VND/month for an AI-guided home intervention platform if it demonstrates 78% improvement rate within 3 months.

**Negative:** We believe that parents will NOT pay for digital intervention if they can access free tools like A365.vn, regardless of superior features, because they prioritize "free" over "effective."

**Test:** Pre-sales landing page with pricing tiers, collect 100 email signups + 10 paid deposits.

---

#### Hypothesis 2: Home Intervention Effectiveness (CRITICAL)
**Positive:** We believe that parent-led home intervention guided by 10-15 min daily AI activities WILL produce equivalent developmental gains to 1-hour center-based sessions within 6 months.

**Negative:** We believe that parents will NOT achieve meaningful results without in-person professional oversight, regardless of AI guidance quality, because home environments lack therapeutic structure.

**Test:** Wizard-of-Oz MVP with 20 families - therapist manually creates "AI" recommendations, measure speech milestone progress vs. control group.

---

#### Hypothesis 3: AI Accuracy (CRITICAL - Feasibility)
**Positive:** We believe that computer vision AI trained on 500 Vietnamese children videos WILL accurately detect developmental milestones (speech, motor, social) with 85%+ accuracy compared to licensed therapist assessment.

**Negative:** We believe that AI will NOT achieve clinical-grade accuracy on Vietnamese children because available training data is insufficient and culturally-specific behaviors (e.g., Vietnamese parenting styles) confound the model.

**Test:** Collect 100 parent-uploaded videos, have both AI and 3 licensed therapists independently score milestones, calculate inter-rater reliability.

---

#### Hypothesis 4: Daily Engagement Habit (CRITICAL - Desirability)
**Positive:** We believe that parents WILL complete 10-15 min daily activities at 70%+ consistency (5+ days/week) if gamification elements (streaks, badges, milestone celebrations) are included.

**Negative:** We believe that parents will NOT maintain daily engagement beyond 2-4 weeks regardless of gamification, because intervention fatigue and competing priorities (work, other children) prevent habit formation.

**Test:** Build MVP app with 30-day activity calendar + gamification, track completion rates for 50 beta families, measure drop-off points.

---

#### Hypothesis 5: Free-to-Paid Conversion (CRITICAL - Viability)
**Positive:** We believe that 10-15% of free tier users WILL convert to 500K VND/month premium subscriptions within 3 months if they see measurable progress (child speaks 10+ new words) tracked by AI.

**Negative:** We believe that free users will NOT convert to paid regardless of progress visibility, because they will attribute gains to "natural development" rather than platform effectiveness, or because 500K/month is still too expensive for their budget.

**Test:** Launch freemium MVP with 30 basic activities (free) + 365 activities + AI tracking (paid), track conversion funnel for 200 free users over 90 days.

---

### 10.2 SHARE Quadrant (Important + Have Evidence)
**Validate existing evidence - can move quickly**

#### Hypothesis 6: Search Demand Exists
**Evidence:** Google Trends shows high volume for "trẻ tự kỷ," "can thiệp sớm," "trẻ chậm nói" in Vietnam. Voz forums have 13-page threads with thousands of views. National Children's Hospital receives 10,000 autism checkups annually.

**Validation:** Run Google Search ads for 1 month, measure CTR and conversion to email signup. Target: 5%+ CTR, 500 VND/click CPA.

---

#### Hypothesis 7: Financial Pain is Severe
**Evidence:** Social listening confirms families "burning 50M VND/month," going into "billions in debt," and one parent opening their own center out of desperation. Centers cost 5.5-8.5M VND/month + 3M intervention.

**Validation:** Survey 100 parents (via Voz, Facebook groups): "What % of household income goes to intervention?" Expected: 30-50%+ for middle class.

---

### 10.3 DEFER Quadrant (Unimportant + No Evidence)
**Address later - low priority**

#### Hypothesis 8: Offline Mode Necessity (Lower Priority)
**Positive:** We believe that rural families WILL require offline mode to use the platform because internet connectivity in provincial areas is unreliable.

**Negative:** We believe that rural families will NOT use the platform regardless of offline mode, because smartphone penetration and digital literacy are too low in target demographics.

**Test:** Defer until Year 2 - focus on urban Hanoi/HCMC first (40% of TAM). Survey rural parents after urban PMF achieved.

---

### 10.4 MONITOR Quadrant (Unimportant + Have Evidence)
**Keep on radar - low risk**

#### Hypothesis 9: Community Reduces Isolation
**Evidence:** Voz forums demonstrate parents actively seek peer support, with threads receiving hundreds of replies. A365.vn users gave positive feedback on community features.

**Validation:** Launch basic forum MVP, track DAU/MAU ratio and posts per user. Moderate evidence suggests this will work.

---

#### Hypothesis 10: Therapist Marketplace Has Supply
**Evidence:** "Mấy bà cô dạy can thiệp hái ra tiền" (intervention teachers raking in money) suggests therapists are eager for additional income. Existing centers employ therapists who could moonlight.

**Validation:** Recruit 10 therapists for marketplace pilot, offer 350K VND/session (70% revenue share). Monitor booking fill rate.

---

## 11. Strategic Recommendations

### 11.1 Blue Ocean Execution Strategy

**Phase 1: Hanoi/HCMC Beachhead (Months 1-12)**
- Target: 2,000 paying families @ 500K/month = 12B VND revenue (~$480K USD)
- Focus: Urban middle class with diagnosed children ages 2-5
- Channel: Facebook parent groups, pediatrician referrals, Voz forum seeding

**Phase 2: Platform Scaling (Months 13-24)**
- Target: 7,500 paying families @ 600K/month = 54B VND revenue (~$2.16M USD)
- Expand: Add B2B SaaS for intervention centers (white-label home reinforcement)
- Product: Launch AI-powered predictive modeling ("80% likely to speak by month 8")

**Phase 3: Ecosystem Play (Months 25-36)**
- Target: 15,000 paying families @ 750K/month = 135B VND revenue (~$5.4M USD)
- Ecosystem: Center/therapist marketplace with transparent ratings, government pilot programs
- Geography: Expand to Da Nang, Can Tho, Hai Phong (secondary cities)

### 11.2 Competitive Moats

1. **Data Moat:** 1,000s of Vietnamese children's developmental data → superior AI accuracy
2. **Network Effects:** More parents → more success stories → higher conversion
3. **Regulatory Moat:** Class A/B medical device registration (3+ year barrier for competitors)
4. **Clinical Validation:** Published research with National Children's Hospital
5. **Brand Trust:** "78% improvement rate" becomes industry standard benchmark

### 11.3 Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low AI Accuracy on Vietnamese Children**
- Mitigation: Hybrid model - AI provides initial screening, therapist reviews edge cases
- Fallback: Manual activity recommendations (Wizard of Oz) until AI improves

**Risk 2: Parents Don't Maintain Daily Engagement**
- Mitigation: Heavy gamification, social accountability (cohort-based challenges), SMS reminders
- Pivot: Reduce from 10-15 min daily to 5 min 3x/week if compliance fails

**Risk 3: Regulatory Crackdown on "Medical Device"**
- Mitigation: Launch as "educational platform," partner with licensed hospital for credibility
- Pivot: Operate marketplace-only model (connect parents to therapists) if forced to exit content business

**Risk 4: Insufficient Therapist Supply for Marketplace**
- Mitigation: Recruit internationally (Vietnamese diaspora SLPs in US/Australia via telehealth)
- Pivot: Focus on AI-only model, remove human consultation if supply doesn't scale

**Risk 5: Incumbent (A365.vn) Modernizes Platform**
- Mitigation: Speed to market - launch MVP within 6 months before they react
- Moat: Superior AI personalization, community features, freemium conversion funnel

---

## 12. Data Limitations & Research Gaps

### 12.1 Acknowledged Limitations

**Data Recency:**
- ✅ All prevalence data within 12 months (2024-2026 studies)
- ✅ Digital adoption data from January 2025 (DataReportal)
- ✅ Social listening from active 2024-2026 forum threads
- ⚠️ Center pricing not publicly listed (estimated from parent reports 2023-2024)

**Competitive Intelligence:**
- ✅ All competitors verified with active websites/social presence
- ⚠️ Cùng Con app pricing unknown (Play Store listing doesn't disclose)
- ⚠️ A365.vn user numbers outdated (last reported 2016)
- ⚠️ Center effectiveness data unavailable (no public outcome reporting)

**Market Sizing:**
- ✅ Population data from official sources (Worldometer, Vietnam GSO)
- ⚠️ Overlap between autism/ADHD/speech delay not precisely measured
- ⚠️ Middle class definition varies by source (30-55% range)
- ⚠️ Rural smartphone penetration estimates (40-60%) lack precision

### 12.2 Primary Research Required

**Before MVP Development:**
1. **Willingness-to-Pay Study:** Survey 200 parents on pricing sensitivity (500K, 750K, 1M VND/month tiers)
2. **Feature Prioritization:** Interview 50 parents to rank importance of AI tracking vs. community vs. expert consultations
3. **Therapist Supply:** Recruit 10 therapists for marketplace pilot, test revenue share model
4. **Content Validation:** Have 3 licensed SLPs review 30 intervention activities for clinical accuracy

**Post-MVP Launch:**
5. **Effectiveness RCT:** Randomized controlled trial with 100 families (50 platform, 50 waitlist control), measure speech milestones at 3/6/12 months
6. **AI Accuracy Audit:** Compare AI milestone detection to therapist ratings (inter-rater reliability study)
7. **Engagement Cohort Analysis:** Track retention curves by signup source, family income, child severity
