# Social Listening Report: Disability Accessibility in Vietnam

**Date:** 30.01.26
**Research Method:** Social Listening - Vietnamese Forums, News, Expert Sources
**Focus:** Pain points, workarounds, and unmet needs of PWDs (People with Disabilities)

---

## Executive Summary

This social listening research uncovered significant pain points experienced by Vietnam's **7+ million people with disabilities**, with particular focus on the **2.5 million deaf/hard-of-hearing** and **~1 million visually impaired** populations. Key findings reveal severe gaps in healthcare communication, government service accessibility, and digital inclusion. Only **10 sign language interpreters** serve the entire country, and **100% of visually impaired users surveyed** cannot access online government services. These findings present clear opportunities for AI-powered accessibility solutions.

## 1. Pain Points: Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing Community

### 1.1 Healthcare Access Crisis

**Quote (Vietnamese + Translation):**
> "Gần cả giờ xếp hàng chờ khám phụ khoa, hai phụ nữ khiếm thính đến lượt vào phòng gặp bác sĩ. Khi không thể giao tiếp bình thường, cả bệnh nhân và bác sĩ đều ra dấu tay và không ai hiểu ai. Cuộc khám kết thúc chỉ sau một phút."
>
> *"After nearly an hour waiting in line for a gynecological exam, two hearing-impaired women entered the doctor's room. Unable to communicate normally, both patient and doctor gestured with their hands and neither understood the other. The exam ended after just one minute."*
> — [iSEE Vietnam](https://www.isee.org.vn/goc-nhin/rao-can-ngon-ngu-trong-khi-di-benh-vien)

**Key Pain Points:**
| Pain Point | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| No interpreters at hospitals | Only 10 sign language interpreters in all of Vietnam |
| Misunderstandings with life-threatening consequences | Case of pregnant deaf woman being sent for abortion due to miscommunication |
| Waiting room announcements not accessible | Hospitals call patient names verbally; deaf patients miss their turn |
| Interpreter exclusion | Some doctors refuse to allow interpreters in exam room |
| Only 7% access healthcare fully | Survey: Only 7/100 deaf respondents get full healthcare access |

**Quote:**
> "Chúng tôi cần hướng dẫn cụ thể và có sự tôn trọng khi tham gia các dịch vụ khám chữa bệnh."
>
> *"We need specific guidance and respect when participating in medical examination services."*
> — Lan Anh, deaf community member ([CED.org.vn](https://www.ced.org.vn/tin-tuc/tin-trong-va-ngoai-nuoc/nguoi-khiem-thinh-gap-kho-khi-di-kham-chua-benh))

### 1.2 Family Communication Barriers

**Quote:**
> "Trong nhiều gia đình hầu hết cha mẹ và những người thân không biết sử dụng ngôn ngữ ký hiệu nên gặp khó khăn trong giao tiếp."
>
> *"In most families, parents and relatives do not know sign language, so they face difficulties in communication."*
> — [Thanh Nien](https://thanhnien.vn/me-hoc-ngon-ngu-ky-hieu-de-tam-su-voi-co-con-gai-diec-185230830014317842.htm)

**Key Pain Points:**
- Parents lack access to sign language training
- Parents too busy to attend classes at special schools
- Learning sign language requires 2-3 years; many give up
- Children become isolated within their own families
- Deaf children experience behavioral issues (tantrums, frustration) due to communication barriers

### 1.3 Technology Access Barriers

**Quote:**
> "Hàng ngày, cộng đồng người khiếm thính phải đối mặt với nhiều rào cản. Họ gặp khó khăn trong việc giao tiếp và tìm kiếm thông tin dẫn tới thiếu cơ sở để bày tỏ mong muốn cá nhân."
>
> *"Every day, the hearing-impaired community faces many barriers. They have difficulty communicating and finding information, leading to a lack of basis to express personal wishes."*
