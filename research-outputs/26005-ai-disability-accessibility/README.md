## v2 Research Summary

The v2 report synthesizes research from **5 specialized agents**:

1. **Search Trends** - Global AT market $25-36B, Asia-Pacific fastest growing
2. **Social Listening** - Pain points from deaf/blind communities
3. **Market Size / Who Pays** - B2C not viable, B2G via NGO is best entry
4. **Global Success Models** - Ava, Be My Eyes, SignAll business patterns
5. **DFV Risk Assessment** - 18 risks identified, top 3 critical

## Key Findings (v2)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Blue Ocean Score | HIGH |
| Market size (TAM) | $25-36B global |
| Realistic SOM (3-year) | **$3M** |
| Top risk | VSL dataset inadequacy |
| Digital divide | 36-point gap (PWDs: 42.5% vs general: 78.8%) |
| Sign language interpreters | Only 10 nationwide |
| Local competitors | None |

---

## Who Pays Analysis

| Segment | Budget | Pain | Verdict |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| B2G (via USAID/NGO) | HIGH ($155M+ historical) | HIGH | **PRIMARY** |
| B2B Healthcare | MEDIUM ($1.26B digital) | MEDIUM | **SECONDARY** |
| B2B Education | LOW ($3M/year) | HIGH | **PILOT** |
| B2B Corporate | LOW-MEDIUM | LOW | **DEFER** |
| B2C End Users | VERY LOW (32.5% poverty) | HIGH | **FREE TIER** |

---

## Top 3 Risks

| Rank | Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | VSL dataset inadequacy (only 1,000 signs) | HIGH | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Big Tech free solutions | HIGH | HIGH |
| 3 | PWD affordability | HIGH | HIGH |

**Differentiation:** Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) is NOT supported by any Big Tech solution.

---

## Recommendations

| Model | Viability |
|-------|-----------|
| B2G (Government via NGO) | HIGH - Best entry point |
| B2B (Healthcare) | HIGH - 1,645 hospitals |
| B2B (Education) | MEDIUM - NGO-funded |
| B2C | LOW - Income constraints |

**Recommended Path:**
1. Partner with USAID/NGO as technology provider
2. Build VSL vocabulary learning app (not real-time translation)
3. Pilot with hospitals for B2B revenue
4. Scale via government relationships

## Revenue Model

| Segment | Model | Pricing |
|---------|-------|---------|
| End Users (PWDs) | FREE | $0 |
| NGO/Grant Projects | Project-based | $50K-200K/project |
| Healthcare (Hospitals) | Per-facility SaaS | $500-2,000/month |
| Corporate (MNCs) | Per-employee | $200-500/month |
| Government | Enterprise license | Negotiated |

---

## Global Success Models Referenced

| Company | Focus | Funding | Key Learning |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Ava | Live captioning | $14.88M | Freemium B2C + B2B Enterprise |
| Be My Eyes | Visual assistance | $17.4M | Free B2C, enterprise pays |
| SignAll | Sign language | $3.63M | Acquired by Snapchat |
| Hand Talk | Brazilian SL | $1.47M | Emerging market model |

## Hypotheses to Test

| # | Hypothesis | Method |
|---|-----------|--------|
| H1 | Deaf users will use VSL vocabulary app | User interviews (20+) |
| H2 | Hospitals will pay $500+/month | Mock sales (5 hospitals) |
| H3 | HAD/VNAH will partner on dataset | Partnership negotiation |
| H4 | Can achieve 85%+ VSL accuracy | Technical prototype |

---

## Next Steps

1. Interview Hanoi Association of the Deaf (HAD)
2. Request meetings with VNAH, UNICEF Vietnam
3. Review USAID Inclusion III-b application
4. Build VSL recognition prototype with existing dataset
5. Apply for Microsoft AI for Accessibility grant

## Research Methodology (v2)

This v2 research used multi-agent methodology:

```
Search Trends Agent ─────┐
Social Listening Agent ──┼──> Comprehensive v2 Report
Market Size Agent ───────┤
Global Models Agent ─────┤
DFV Risk Agent ──────────┘
```

All agents ran in parallel, gathering data from:
- Market research reports (Coherent MI, CMI, MRFR)
- Government statistics (UNICEF, UNDP, NSO Vietnam)
- Startup databases (Crunchbase, Tracxn, PitchBook)
- Technical papers (Nature, MDPI, WACV)
- News sources (TechCrunch, Berkeley News)
