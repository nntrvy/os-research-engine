**Prepared for:** OS Research Startup Studio
**Research Area:** Health / Social Welfare
**Report Version:** v2 (Multi-Agent Research)

---

## Executive Summary

This v2 report synthesizes research from 5 specialized agents analyzing: search trends, social listening, market size/payer analysis, global success models, and DFV (Desirability-Feasibility-Viability) risk assessment.

**Key Finding:** The opportunity exists but requires a **specific path**: freemium B2C (for impact) + B2B/B2G revenue (for sustainability). Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) is the differentiated opportunity—Big Tech doesn't serve it.

| Assessment | Rating | Key Evidence |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Blue Ocean Score | **HIGH** | No local competitors, VSL underserved |
| Market Size (TAM) | $25-36B global | Asia-Pacific fastest growing (5-10% CAGR) |
| Realistic SOM (3-year) | **$3M** | NGO grants + B2B healthcare pilots |
| Top Risk | VSL dataset inadequacy | Only 1,000 signs in largest dataset |
| Recommended Entry | **B2G via NGO partners** | USAID has $155M+ historical spend |

| **3** | V1 | PWD affordability | HIGH | HIGH |
| **4** | F2 | Real-world SL accuracy | HIGH | HIGH |
| **5** | V4 | Big tech competition | HIGH | HIGH |
| 6 | D2 | Preference for humans | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| 7 | D3 | Low digital literacy | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| 8 | F6 | Dataset collection cost | HIGH | HIGH |
| 9 | V2 | B2B/B2G sales cycle | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| 10 | V3 | Grant dependency | MEDIUM | HIGH |

### 4.2 Top 3 Critical Risks

#### Risk #1: VSL Dataset Inadequacy (F1)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Current largest dataset | 1,000 signs, 84,000 videos |
| Required for production | 2,000-5,000+ signs |
| Regional variations | 3 recognized sign languages in Vietnam |
| Mitigation | Partner with HAD, apply for research grants |

**Hypothesis to Test:** "We can partner with HAD/VNAH to collect 2,000+ sign vocabulary within 12 months for under $200,000."

#### Risk #2: Big Tech Free Solutions (D4)

| Competitor | Vietnamese Support | Gap |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| Google Live Transcribe | Vietnamese speech-to-text ✓ | No VSL |
| Apple Live Captions | Vietnamese limited | No VSL |
| Be My Eyes | Available in Vietnam | No VSL |

**Differentiation:** Vietnamese Sign Language is NOT supported by any Big Tech solution.

#### Risk #3: PWD Affordability (V1)

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PWD household poverty rate | 32.5% |
| Monthly benefits | 83% of poverty line |
| Assistive device costs | $425-$1,275 (prohibitive) |

**Mitigation:** Free B2C tier, monetize through B2B/B2G. PWDs will never be primary revenue source.

### 4.3 Technical Feasibility Summary

| Feature | Risk Level | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Vietnamese TTS | **LOW** | Mature (Viettel AI 95% human-like) |
| Speech-to-text | **LOW** | Google supports Vietnamese offline |
| Sign Language (VSL) | **HIGH** | Dataset limited to 1,000 signs |
| Offline AI | **MEDIUM** | Requires optimization for budget phones |
| Government integration | **MEDIUM** | APIs fragmented but available |

### 4.4 Sign Language Recognition Accuracy Gap

| Environment | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Lab (static gestures) | 98.1% | Controlled conditions |
| Lab (continuous signing) | 88% | Multiple signers |
| Real-world (varied lighting) | 70-85% | Significant degradation |
| Cross-dialect | 60% | 40% performance drop |

**Implication:** Do NOT promise real-time VSL translation in v1. Start with vocabulary learning, phrase recognition.

## 7. Hypotheses to Test Before Building

Based on OSR's Assumptions Map methodology, these hypotheses require immediate testing:

### EXPERIMENT (Important + No Evidence)

| # | Hypothesis | Test Method |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| H1 | "Deaf users will use a VSL vocabulary app because no alternatives exist" | User interviews (20+ deaf users) |
| H2 | "Hospitals will pay $500+/month for patient communication tools" | Mock sales with 5 hospitals |
| H3 | "HAD/VNAH will partner on VSL dataset collection" | Partnership negotiation |
| H4 | "We can achieve 85%+ VSL recognition accuracy with 1,000-sign dataset" | Technical prototype |

### SHARE (Important + Have Evidence)

| # | Hypothesis | Evidence |
|---|-----------|----------|
| H5 | "Vietnamese TTS is mature and available" | Viettel AI 95% human-like |
| H6 | "PWDs cannot afford paid subscriptions" | 32.5% poverty rate data |
| H7 | "Government lacks digital accessibility tools" | 0/63 portals WCAG compliant |

### DEFER (Unimportant + No Evidence)

| # | Hypothesis | Reason to Defer |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| H8 | "Corporate 3% quota will drive demand" | Weak enforcement observed |
| H9 | "B2C premium tier will generate revenue" | Proven unviable by Be My Eyes |
