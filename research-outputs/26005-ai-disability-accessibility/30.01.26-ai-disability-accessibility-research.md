# AI-Powered Assistive Technology for People with Disabilities in Vietnam

## Market Opportunity Research Report

**Date:** 30.01.26
**Prepared for:** OS Research Startup Studio
**Research Area:** Health / Social Welfare

---

## Executive Summary

Vietnam has approximately **6.2 million people with disabilities** (7% of population), with **75% living in rural areas**. The market faces significant gaps in accessible technology solutions, despite progressive disability legislation. Key opportunities exist in Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) recognition (limited research data available), Vietnamese text-to-speech (mature technology from Viettel/FPT), and offline-capable AI apps for rural connectivity challenges. The regulatory environment is supportive (Law on Persons with Disabilities 2010, CRPD ratification 2014), with mandatory accessibility requirements for buildings effective January 2025.

**Blue Ocean Assessment:** HIGH - No local competitors, government mandate, first-mover advantage possible.

## 1. Vietnam Disability Statistics

### 1.1 Population Overview

| Metric | Value | Source Year |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total PWDs | 6.2 million | 2016-2017 |
| % of Population | 7% | UNICEF |
| Children with Disabilities | 556,000 | 2023 |
| Rural Population | 75% (3.9 million) | 2016-2017 |

### 1.2 Breakdown by Disability Type

| Type | Percentage | Est. Population |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Mental/Intelligence | 31% | ~1.9M |
| Locomotion/Mobility | 27% | ~1.7M |
| Vision | 15% | ~0.9M |
| Hearing & Speech | 15% | ~0.9M |
| Other | 12% | ~0.7M |

### 1.3 Geographic Distribution

- **Rural areas:** 75% of PWDs (limited internet, healthcare access)
- **Urban areas:** 25% of PWDs (better infrastructure, still accessibility gaps)
- **Internet access for PWDs:** 42.5% (2024), up from 38.9% (2023)

**Key Insight:** The rural concentration (3.9 million people) creates strong demand for **offline-capable solutions**.

## 2. Current Solutions & Competitors

### 2.1 International Solutions Available in Vietnam

| App | Function | Vietnam Support |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| **Google Live Transcribe** | Real-time speech-to-text | Vietnamese supported, offline available |
| **Be My Eyes** | Connects blind users with volunteers | Available, language support unclear |
| **Seeing AI (Microsoft)** | AI scene/text description | Limited Vietnamese |
| **Ava** | Group conversation captioning | English-focused |

**Gap:** None specifically designed for Vietnamese context, government service integration, or Vietnamese Sign Language.

### 2.2 Vietnamese Text-to-Speech Solutions

| Provider | Features | Quality |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Viettel AI TTS** | 16 voices (3 regions), 95% human-like | Commercial, high quality |
| **FPT.AI TTS** | 7+ regional voices, API available | Commercial |
| **Zalo AI TTS** | 4 voices (North/South) | Commercial |
| **VietTTS (Open Source)** | Voice cloning, OpenAI API compatible | Free, good quality |

**Key Insight:** Vietnamese TTS is **mature and accessible**. This is NOT a gap to solve.

### 2.3 Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) Tools

**Current State: Early Research Stage**

| Dataset/Project | Size | Accuracy | Notes |
|-----------------|------|----------|-------|
| Multi-VSL (2024) | 1,000 signs, 84,764 samples | N/A | 30 different camera views |
| VSL Alphabet Recognition | 23 letters + 2 accents | 91-95% | Deep learning + MediaPipe |
| Dynamic Object Extraction | 27 signs, 2,700 samples | 98-99% | GoogLeNet + BiLSTM |

**Critical Gap:**
- Only ~1,000 signs in largest dataset (conversational sign language requires 2,000-5,000+)
- No production-ready VSL recognition app exists
- Only **10 sign language interpreters** in all of Vietnam

---

## 3. Government & Policy

### 3.1 Legal Framework

| Legislation | Year | Key Provisions |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Law on Persons with Disabilities | 2010 | Equal access to health, education, employment |
| UN CRPD Ratification | 2014 | International disability rights standards |
| Decree 20/2021/ND-CP | 2021 | Social assistance policies |
| Decree 76/2024/ND-CP | 2024 | Updated disability support |
| Law on Digital Technology Industry | 2025 | AI governance, disability protection mentioned |

### 3.2 Digital Accessibility Requirements

**As of January 1, 2025:** All residential apartment blocks, office buildings, infrastructure works, and social public buildings must ensure accessibility features.

**Digital Service Gaps:**
- 25.6% of PWDs who tried government e-service portals found them difficult to navigate
- Poor web design lacks screen-reader compatibility
- Inclusive design seen as "financial burden" rather than standard

**Key Insight:** Government is mandating accessibility but lacks digital tools to comply. **B2G opportunity exists.**
