## What Happens Here

### 1. Problem Hunting
- Social listening (forums, communities)
- Market research
- Trend analysis
- Competitive landscape

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Identify distinct customer groups
- Understand different needs/pain points
- Prioritize segments by opportunity size

### 3. Customer Profiles
- Jobs to be done
- Pains and gains
- Value Proposition Canvas

### 4. Key Assumptions
- List critical assumptions
- Prioritize by risk (Assumptions Map)
- Design validation experiments

### 5. Problem Validation
- Customer interviews
- Surveys
- Behavior observation
- Evidence collection

### 6. Market Sizing
- TAM / SAM / SOM
- Growth trends
- Blue Ocean opportunity scoring
