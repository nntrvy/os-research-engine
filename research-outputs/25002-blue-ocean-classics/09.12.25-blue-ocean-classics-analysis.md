## 10. Tesla (2008)

### Blue Ocean Strategy Overview
Tesla created uncontested market space by making **electric cars desirable performance vehicles**, targeting luxury car buyers and tech enthusiasts rather than eco-conscious Prius owners. They eliminated dealerships, gasoline engines, and compromises on speed/range while creating over-the-air updates, Autopilot, and Supercharger networks.

**Four Actions Framework:**
- **ELIMINATE:** Dealerships, gasoline/oil changes, emissions, traditional car advertising
- **REDUCE:** Maintenance frequency, model variations, physical controls (touchscreen UI)
- **RAISE:** Acceleration (0-60 in 2.3 sec), tech features, brand desirability
- **CREATE:** Over-the-air software updates, Supercharger network, Autopilot, direct-to-consumer sales

## Strategic Insights Across All 10 Examples

### Common Blue Ocean Patterns

1. **Target Non-Customers**: All 10 examples created new demand by appealing to people who weren't buying existing solutions:
   - Nintendo: Non-gamers (families, seniors)
   - Cirque du Soleil: Adults who thought circuses were "for kids"
   - Dyson: Homeowners tired of vacuum bag costs
   - Southwest: People who drove instead of flying
   - Yellow Tail: Beer/cocktail drinkers avoiding wine intimidation
   - Curves: Women intimidated by traditional gyms
   - iTunes: Music lovers pirating due to CD bundling
   - Netflix: Movie fans frustrated by late fees
   - IKEA: Young people priced out of furniture market
   - Tesla: Luxury buyers dismissing EVs as "golf carts"

2. **Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Framework**: Each company systematically reconstructed industry factors:
   - **Eliminate** costly elements customers didn't value (animals in circus, vacuum bags, flight meals)
   - **Reduce** features over-served by competitors (graphics power in gaming, wine complexity)
   - **Raise** elements above industry standard (Nintendo physical activity, IKEA design)
   - **Create** entirely new factors (motion controls, flat-pack furniture, Superchargers)

3. **Value Innovation Over Technology**: Blue oceans aren't necessarily high-tech:
   - IKEA's flat-pack was low-tech engineering brilliance
   - Yellow Tail simplified winemaking, didn't invent new grapes
   - Southwest flew the same planes, just used them differently
   - Curves used simple hydraulic equipment, not advanced machines

4. **Pricing Strategy**: Most made solutions MORE affordable by eliminating costs:
   - Southwest: Half the price of major carriers
   - Yellow Tail: $6-8 vs $15-30 wines
   - Curves: $30/month vs $60-100 gyms
   - IKEA: 50-70% cheaper than traditional furniture
   - **Exception**: Dyson, Tesla, Cirque charged PREMIUMS by reframing value

5. **Ecosystem Building**: Winners created supporting infrastructure:
   - iTunes + iPod ecosystem
   - Tesla Supercharger network
   - IKEA Småland + Restaurant (shopping experience)
   - Curves franchise community support

### Lessons for OS Research

**When Hunting Blue Oceans in Vietnam:**

1. **Look for Over-Served and Under-Served Segments**:
   - Are urban Vietnamese over-paying for features they don't use?
   - Are rural/elderly segments completely ignored?

2. **Challenge Industry Assumptions**:
   - "Insurance requires agents" → What if digital-only?
   - "Education needs classrooms" → What if mobile-first?
   - "Healthcare requires hospitals" → What if telemedicine?

3. **Study Workarounds**:
   - What are people doing because real solutions don't exist?
   - Yellow Tail succeeded because people drank beer when they wanted wine

4. **Test "Affordable Premium"**:
   - Can you deliver 70% of luxury experience at 30% of price? (IKEA model)
   - Or deliver 130% quality at 300% price? (Dyson/Tesla model)

5. **Build Movements, Not Just Products**:
   - Nintendo made gaming a family activity
   - Curves built women's fitness community
   - Tesla created climate action through performance cars
