# Speech Practice Studio - Idea Refinement

**Ref:** 26008
**Date:** 03.02.26
**Status:** Idea Stage - Needs Validation

---

## Executive Summary

A "private speech gym" combining soundproof practice booths with an AI-powered app for gamified movie scene practice. Target: introverts and professionals who avoid speaking practice due to fear of judgment.

**Core Insight:** The "humanless + judgment-free" positioning is a genuine blue ocean — Toastmasters, language centers, and speech coaches cannot offer this.

---

## Problem Statement

Vietnamese professionals (30+) struggle to improve speaking skills because they lack a judgment-free environment for regular practice with objective feedback. Current solutions (classes, Toastmasters, self-recording) either expose them to social judgment or fail to provide structured feedback, leaving them stuck in a cycle of avoidance and stagnation.

---

## Value Proposition

We want to create **a network of soundproof practice studios with an AI-powered mobile app** to **help introverted professionals overcome speaking anxiety and improve voice quality through gamified movie scene practice** for **Vietnamese professionals aged 30+ who avoid public speaking training due to fear of judgment** with **completely private, humanless booths that eliminate social pressure while providing instant AI feedback—something traditional language centers and Toastmasters cannot offer**.

---

## Target Customer Profile

| **Movie licensing** | MEDIUM | Use public domain, original scripts, or Vietnamese content |
| **AI feedback credibility** | MEDIUM | Hybrid model: AI instant feedback + optional human review |
| **Booth utilization** | HIGH | Corporate B2B contracts, multi-use (podcasting, meditation) |
| **Location strategy** | MEDIUM | Avoid high-visibility locations; test residential vs office areas |

---

## Competitive Landscape (To Research)

**Direct Alternatives:**
- Toastmasters clubs
- Language centers (VUS, ILA, etc.)
- Private speech coaches
- Self-recording at home

**Adjacent Solutions:**

- Music practice rooms
- Meditation pods
- Podcast recording studios

**Software Competitors:**
- Speech coaching apps (Orai, Speeko, Yoodli)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Validate Demand (Before Building Anything)

1. **Social Listening** - Search Vietnamese forums for:
   - Fear of public speaking (nỗi sợ nói trước đám đông)
   - English speaking practice challenges
   - Job interview preparation struggles

2. **Fake Door Test** - Landing page + Facebook ads:
   - "Private AI Speaking Coach Booths Coming to HCMC"
   - Measure sign-ups and interest

3. **Customer Interviews** (10 target users):
   - "When did you last avoid speaking up due to fear of judgment?"
   - "What have you tried to improve speaking? Why did you stop?"
   - "Would you pay 150K VND for 1-hour private practice with AI feedback?"

### Phase 2: Test Core Value Proposition

4. **Wizard of Oz Test**:
   - Users submit voice recordings via simple app
   - Human expert provides feedback disguised as "AI"
   - Measure if users find feedback valuable enough to return

5. **Software-Only MVP**:
   - App with movie scenes + basic AI feedback
   - Users practice at home with headphones
   - Validate engagement before physical investment

### Phase 3: Physical Pilot (Only If Demand Proven)

6. **Single Booth Pilot**:
   - Partner with co-working space or cafe
   - Test utilization rates and willingness to pay
   - Iterate on experience before scaling
