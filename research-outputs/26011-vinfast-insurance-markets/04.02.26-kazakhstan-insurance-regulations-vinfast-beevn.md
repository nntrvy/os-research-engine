## 7. Key Assumptions and Data Limitations

### 7.1 Hypotheses Requiring Validation

Following the OS Research hypothesis format ("We believe that..."):

**Desirability (Market Risk):**
1. **We believe that** Vinfast will require local insurance broker partnerships to effectively navigate Kazakhstan's regulatory environment and cultural business practices.

2. **We believe that** the EV-specific insurance market in Kazakhstan is underdeveloped, creating an opportunity for specialized EV insurance products.

3. **We believe that** corporate clients in Kazakhstan prefer bundled insurance solutions covering multiple risk types (motor, property, liability) from a single broker.

**Feasibility (Infrastructure Risk):**
4. **We believe that** BeeVN can establish a branch office in Kazakhstan within 6-12 months given adequate documentation from Vietnam regulators.

5. **We believe that** Kazakhstan insurance companies have sufficient capacity to underwrite large EV manufacturing and fleet operations without extensive reinsurance arrangements.

6. **We believe that** the electronic licensing and policy issuance systems in Kazakhstan will accommodate foreign broker operations efficiently.

**Viability (Financial Risk):**
7. **We believe that** premium volumes from Vinfast's Kazakhstan operations (manufacturing facility, fleet, employee benefits) will exceed branch establishment and operating costs within 24 months.

8. **We believe that** the 24% insurance market growth rate will continue, driven by EV adoption and economic expansion, making the market attractive for new broker entrants.

### 7.2 Data Gaps and Limitations

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **EV-Specific Insurance Products:** No specific information found on EV insurance products, premium rates, or coverage terms in Kazakhstan
2. **CAR Insurance Requirements:** Mandatory CAR insurance requirements for construction projects not confirmed
3. **Fleet/Taxi Insurance Details:** Specific regulatory requirements for commercial fleet insurance not found in recent sources
4. **Broker Commission Structures:** No data on typical broker compensation or commission rates
5. **Foreign Broker Market Share:** No statistics on existing foreign broker presence or market share

**Data Recency:**
- Most regulatory framework data from 2023-2025 (acceptable)
- Market statistics current to May-September 2025 (excellent)
- Some general insurance principles applied due to lack of Kazakhstan-specific detail

**Recommended Primary Research:**
1. Direct consultation with ARDFM regarding foreign broker licensing timeline and requirements
2. Interviews with existing insurance brokers in Kazakhstan
3. Consultation with Kazakhstan insurers on EV insurance products and capacity
4. Engagement with Vinfast Kazakhstan team on specific facility requirements
5. Legal review of all insurance contracts and licensing documents
