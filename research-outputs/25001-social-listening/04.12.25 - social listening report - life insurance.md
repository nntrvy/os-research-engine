## Top Workarounds Found (Strong Evidence)

### 1. Only buy mandatory insurance (BHYT, BHXH)
- **What they're doing:** Avoiding all private life insurance, sticking to government social insurance only
- **Why:** Complete distrust of private insurance companies
- **Opportunity:** Transparent, simple insurance products with clear terms
- **Quote:** "Ngoài bh y tế ra thì k nên mua bất cứ bảo hiểm gì" (Besides health insurance, don't buy any insurance)

- **Opportunity:** Simple savings + protection product with tangible value
- **Quote:** "Thà tự mua vàng sau về hưu bán mà dùng" (Better to buy gold yourself and sell for retirement)

### 3. Unfriend/block anyone who sells insurance

- **Why:** Protection against being pressured/scammed by acquaintances
- **Quote:** "Ai mà chuyển qua làm sales BH là tôi auto unfriend luôn" (Anyone who becomes insurance sales, I automatically unfriend)

### 4. Accept losses and cancel early
- **What they're doing:** Canceling contracts even at significant financial loss
- **Why:** Loss of trust, fear of larger losses later
- **Quote:** "Mất lòng tin, tôi chấp nhận mất tiền phí đã đóng" (Lost trust, I accept losing the fees already paid)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority Hypotheses to Test

1. **Desirability:** "We believe that middle-class Vietnamese parents would pay for a simple term life insurance product with a 1-page transparent contract"
   - **Test:** Landing page with simple product description, measure interest

2. **Desirability:** "We believe that existing policyholders would pay for an independent contract review service before buying insurance"
   - **Test:** Interview 10 people who recently bought insurance

3. **Desirability:** "We believe that Vietnamese consumers would trust insurance sold through a neutral platform (not agents) with recorded video explanations"
   - **Test:** Concierge MVP with recorded consultations

### People to Interview
- People who canceled insurance contracts in 2023-2024
- Family members who lost breadwinners and dealt with insurance claims
- Bank employees who sold insurance (understand incentive structure)
- People who bought gold instead of insurance

### Experiments to Run
- Landing page test: "Would you buy insurance with these features?" (transparent, simple)
- Wizard of Oz: Manual insurance comparison service
- Survey: Willingness to pay for independent insurance advisor

## Key Opportunity Areas

1. **Transparent, simple insurance products** with clear 1-2 page summaries
2. **Independent insurance advisory/comparison services**
3. **Digital-first distribution** bypassing agent networks
4. **Term life insurance** focused purely on protection (not investment)

The strongest evidence of unmet needs comes from the workarounds: people avoiding all private insurance, buying gold instead, and cutting ties with anyone who sells insurance. This indicates a significant trust gap that could be addressed by a new entrant with a radically transparent approach.
