# 26006 - Reintegration Platform Research

## Overview

Research on a social welfare platform to support ex-prisoners (nguoi man han tu) and recovering addicts (nguoi sau cai nghien) reintegrating into Vietnamese society.

## Blue Ocean Reference

Malaysia CRP (Community Rehabilitation Programme) - Instead of building more expensive prisons, Malaysia created CRP centers on military's idle islands, a low-cost solution to overcrowding that gives inmates real second chances. Saved RM 1.33 billion in socio-economic costs.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Target Market | 45,000-55,000 people/year |
| Digital Addressable Market | 13,500-20,000 people/year |
| Relapse Rate | 85-90% within 12 months |
| Employment Rate Post-Rehab | Only 20% |
| Government Budget 2025-2030 | VND 22,400 trillion (~$928M USD) |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Type | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Desirability | 6/10 | Need validated - employer willingness is key risk |
| Feasibility | 5/10 | Technical OK, gov integration challenging |
| Viability | 6/10 | Budget exists, B2G procurement needs validation |

## Proposed Solution

1. Mobile app connecting ex-prisoners/recovering addicts with support services
2. AI-based risk assessment for recidivism/relapse prediction
3. Job matching platform with "trusted intermediary" model
4. Crisis support hotline (24/7)
5. Family support and counseling services
