- Week 10: GO/NO-GO decision for MVP development

### 11. Recommendations

#### Phase 1: B2G + Donor Focus (Year 1)
- Priority: MPS/MOLISA contract via pilot ($500K-1M/year)
- Parallel: UNODC/USAID donor funding ($200-500K)
- Product: Dashboard + AI risk + basic job matching
- Target: 2,000-5,000 people
- Success: 20% recidivism reduction

#### Phase 2: Expand B2B + B2C (Year 2-3)
- B2B: 50-100 SME partnerships
- B2C: Freemium app launch
- Scale: 10,000-20,000 people/year
- Fundraise: Series A $2-5M

#### Blue Ocean Strategy (Four Actions Framework)
**ELIMINATE:**
- "Clean" criminal record requirement
- Stigma in recruitment

**REDUCE:**
- Long-term training costs (focus 3-6 month courses)
- Manual case management (AI + app scale)

**RAISE:**
- Success rate (10% → 40%+)
- Transparency with families (real-time tracking)

**CREATE:**
- AI risk assessment for reintegration (Vietnam first)
- "Second Chance Employer" CSR badge + tax incentives

**Blue Ocean Insight:** Market is RED OCEAN (ineffective rehab centers, 85-90% re-addiction). Create BLUE OCEAN by eliminating stigma, applying technology (AI, apps), and focusing on aftercare - the most neglected but critical phase.
