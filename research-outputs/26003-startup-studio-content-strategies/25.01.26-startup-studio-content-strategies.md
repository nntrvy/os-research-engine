## Key Patterns Across All Studios

### 1. Founder-Led Content
All successful firms have visible founders who personally write/speak. Content from "the company" performs worse than content from individuals.

### 2. Authenticity Over Polish
37Signals and Human Ventures emphasize real stories over manufactured content. Share the journey, not just wins.

### 3. Open-Source Knowledge
The most respected firms give away their methodologies:
- 37Signals: Ruby on Rails, Shape Up, company handbook
- High Alpha: Venture studio guides, benchmarks
- Earlybird: VC comms playbooks

### 4. Long-Form Wins
Blogs, essays, and podcasts outperform social media for building lasting reputation. Short-form supports long-form, not the reverse.

### 5. Consistency > Virality
37Signals has blogged for 25+ years. Earlybird publishes regularly on Medium. None chase viral moments.

### 6. Portfolio as Content
The best marketing is successful companies. Science Inc barely creates content—Dollar Shave Club and Liquid Death do their marketing for them.
