## Key Principles

1. **Research feeds everything** — Every piece of content should trace back to real research or experiments
2. **Internal before external** — Strong internal systems enable consistent external voice
3. **Quality over quantity** — 1 great case study > 10 mediocre posts
4. **Document as you go** — Every process becomes part of the knowledge base
5. **Engage, don't broadcast** — Company voice is a conversation, not a megaphone
