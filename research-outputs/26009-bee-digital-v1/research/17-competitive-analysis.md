## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Lemonade (US) – CX Excellence (5/5)

**What they do well**:
- Extremely simple, clear process
- Build trust through transparency
- Smooth app interface, fast chatbot
- Human, relatable brand storytelling

**Electrik opportunity**: Vietnam insurance is digitized but lacks "wow" CX. If Electrik achieves Lemonade-level experience, massive differentiation from local competitors.

---

### 2. FRISS (Netherlands) – Fraud Scoring (4/5)

**What they do well**:
- AI for risk scoring and fraud prevention
- Prevents losses from the start

**Electrik opportunity**: Fraud in Vietnam car claims is significant.

**Key differentiation**:
> **"Honest Score" instead of "Fraud Score"**
> - Positive framing for customers
> - High-accuracy scoring helps honest customers get faster decisions
> - Same technology, better positioning

---

### 3. Ravin.ai (Israel) – AI Damage Detection (4/5)

**What they do well**:
- AI recognizes damage via camera (phone or inspection points)
- Detects scratches, dents, external damage
- Transparent, objective (AI vs. subjective human disputes)

**Electrik opportunity**: Perfect for EV trend (sensors + data). Transform claims into "one-touch":
- Customer records video
- AI analyzes damage severity
- System suggests preliminary compensation

---

### 4. Root Insurance (US) – Usage-Based Insurance (4/5)

**What they do well**:
- Telematics-based personalized pricing
- "Fair" feeling: safe drivers pay less
- Appeals to young, app-native customers

**Challenges**: Expensive, complex, privacy concerns.

**Electrik opportunity**: Don't copy fully. Apply **light version**:
- Track km driven, charging frequency
- Basic driving indicators (hard braking, acceleration)
- Creates pricing transparency without operational complexity
- EV users already comfortable sharing vehicle data

---

### 5. AiCycle.ai (Vietnam) – Local AI Player (3/5)

**What they do**: AI for fraud detection and claims automation. Board includes Namster Đỗ, partnerships with local insurers.

**Recent pivot**: Shifting toward insurance distribution (becoming a channel) rather than deep AI focus.

**Electrik opportunity**:
- Could be direct competitor in distribution
- BUT their pivot leaves **gap in quality EV-specific tech and CX**
- Electrik can own the specialized technology space they're abandoning

---

### 6. AgileClaim (UK) – Simple Claims (3/5)

**What they do well**: Simplify claims for drivers through clear communication.

**Electrik opportunity**: Learn their communication approach:
- Short videos
- Illustrations
- Step-by-step guides

Not differentiating alone, but essential when combined with AI + CX.

---

### 7. Livegenic (US) – Video Interaction (3/5)

**What they do**: Platform for customers to record/send video to insurers for inspection.

**Value**: Transparency, customer feels "involved," saves time/cost.

**Electrik opportunity**: Integrate as supplementary feature. Builds trust but shouldn't be core strategy.

---

### 8. Proofr.app – AI Damage Scan (3/5)

**What they do**: Photo-based AI detects scratches, dents, damage → PDF report. Used in car rentals, Airbnb.

**Electrik opportunity**: Learn "trust from evidence" approach:
- Before/after documentation
- Mandatory module in claims process
- Increases transparency, speeds processing, reduces fraud

---

### 9. Global Care (Vietnam) – Platform Success (4/5)

**What they do**: Digital platform for sales, contract management, operations. Acquired by Huize (China).

**Electrik opportunity**:
- Learn API connections, smooth backend
- Understand Vietnam market
- **Challenge**: Maintain independence, build differentiation

---

### 10. Local Apps (Bảo Việt, PVI, PTI, MyVNI) – Baseline (2-3/5)

**Current state**: Apps exist for claims submission. But just digitized paperwork - no smooth CX, no AI.

**Electrik opportunity**: **CX + AI = clear superiority**. Can partner instead of compete directly.

---

### 11. PasarPolis (Indonesia) – Ecosystem Play (4/5)

**What they do**: Insurtech serving millions via GoJek, Tokopedia, Grab. Simple UX, microinsurance focus.

**Electrik opportunity**: Learn ecosystem integration:
- Plug into existing apps (EV apps, e-commerce, e-wallets)
- Don't rely solely on standalone app
- Good scale model for Southeast Asia

---

### 12. Igloo (Singapore) – API Insurance (3/5)

**What they do**: Insurance APIs for partners (telco, e-commerce, banks). Fast integration.

**Electrik opportunity**: B2B2C model - use distribution partners for quick customer acquisition.

**Weakness**: Lacks direct CX relationship with end customers.

### Key Differentiator: "Honest Score"

Instead of "Fraud Score" (negative, suspicious framing):
- **Honest Score** = positive framing
- Rewards transparent customers with faster processing
- Same AI technology, better customer psychology
- Builds trust instead of suspicion
