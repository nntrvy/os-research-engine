## What is Claim Triage?

> The process of sorting insurance claims to determine their **urgency, complexity, and required resources** — similar to how medical staff triage patients in an emergency room.

---

## Goals

1. **Efficiently allocate resources**
2. **Ensure prompt handling of critical/high-risk claims**
3. **Streamline simple cases** → reduce costs, improve satisfaction

## How It Works

### Step 1: Assessment

| Factor | Description | Vietnamese |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Severity** | How complex or serious the claim is | Mức độ phức tạp/nghiêm trọng |
| **Risk** | Potential for fraud or high costs | Rủi ro gian lận bảo hiểm |
| **Resource Needs** | What expertise and tools are required | Tài nguyên để xử lý vấn đề |

### Severity Questions

- Are there injuries or fatalities involved?
- Are involved assets no longer operable? (uninhabitable home, totaled car)
- Does this claim require a field adjuster on scene for accurate documentation?

### Step 2: Prioritization

| Category | Description | Handling |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Urgent** | High-risk, complex, or potentially fraudulent | Immediate attention from experienced adjusters |
| **Standard** | Routine or simple claims | Automated or standard processing |

### Step 3: Resource Allocation

Direct specialized staff/tools to claims that need them most.

## Traditional Methods - Pain Points

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Manual review by adjusters | Time-consuming |
| Subjective assessment | Inconsistent decisions |
| Human error | Especially under high claim volumes |
| No scalability | Can't handle volume spikes |
