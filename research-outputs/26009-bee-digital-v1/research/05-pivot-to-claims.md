# 05 - Pivot to Claims

**Date**: Aug 22-24, 2025

---

## The Pivot

**Original hypothesis**: Vingroup wants embedded insurance distribution
**Reality**: Too early, not a priority for them
**New direction**: Solve claims problems (confirmed pain point)

**Later validation**: Vingroup has real demand for:
1. B2C insurance product distribution
2. Comprehensive claims management system for all VinFast cars

## Competitive Landscape - Vietnam Claims Solutions

### Local Players

| Solution | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Merimen / Fermion eClaims** | P&C Motor claims, eSurvey, real-time status updates | Deployed at MIC, widely used in Asia |
| **FPT.AI CarDamage** | AI damage recognition via photo/video | Launched Dec 2022, remote damage assessment |
| **AICycle.AI** | Vietnamese AI-powered insurance platform | Board: Dũng PTI, Ms. Thuy VNI, Thái OPES Head of Claims |

### International Players

| Solution | Description | Relevance |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Ravin AI** (Austin TX) | AI car inspection for insurance, fleet, rental | **Model to learn from** - pivoted from general inspection |
| **Friss** | Trust automation, fraud prevention for full policy cycle | Less relevant - not inspection focused |

### Strategic Partnerships

- **VinFast x 7 insurers** (Dec 2024): PVI, Bảo Việt, BIC, VBI, PTI, BSH, DBV
- Agreement to shorten inspection/approval time for VinFast owners

### Regulatory Context

- **Nghị định 67/2023/NĐ-CP**: Regulates documents & responsibilities for mandatory liability insurance
- Directly affects claims documentation checklist

---

## Social Listening: User Pain Points

### 1. Post-Sales Service Frustration
- Difficult to reach support, slow processing
- "Call hotline - get template answers" - hard to escalate
- Community complaints on VinFast groups

### 2. Warranty/Maintenance Issues
- Poor after-sales processes causing frustration
- Affects trust when claims occur

### 3. Emergency Support Concerns
- Safety concerns and support response times
- Service perception directly impacts claims expectations

### 4. EV Battery Coverage Confusion
- Users unclear if battery is covered
- Separate battery terms, premium differences with/without battery
- Most insurers only cover battery bundled with body, not separately

---

## Unmet Needs Identified

### 1. Transparency in Progress & SLA
Despite eClaims existing, users lack:
- Standard timeline
- Clear SLA
- Near real-time updates
- "Abandoned" feeling when escalation is difficult

### 2. EV-Specific Inspection (Battery, ADAS, Sensors)
- FPT.AI has damage recognition
- **Gap**: EV parts pricing, battery damage assessment rules
- Users confused about battery coverage scope and loss valuation

### 3. Real Insurer ↔ EV Garage Integration
- Current partnerships are agreements only
- Missing: Two-way portal for garage quotes → progress → invoices ↔ insurer approval → payment by milestone

### 4. Easy-to-Understand Policy Terms for EV Owners
- Users search scattered info about battery, surcharges, exclusions
- No tool to transparently show EV coverage by insurer

### 5. Instant Support Channel with Case Ownership
- Need hotline/omni-channel with SLA
- Clear "case owner" mechanism
- Avoid generic apology loops

## Product Implications for Electrik

### 1. EV Claims Hub + Garage Portal

**Features**:
- Transparent milestone tracking: File received → Inspection/Estimate → Approval → Repair → Acceptance → Payment
- Auto push notifications
- Milestone payments between insurer-garage
- Digital documentation, one-touch reconciliation

**Alignment**: Matches market expectation for shortened processing time

### 2. EV Damage & Cost Engine (Key Differentiator)

**Features**:
- Computer Vision (like FPT.AI CarDamage)
- EV parts cost database (battery/electrical/sensors) from authorized garage network
- Evidence-based estimates

**Coverage Explain Module**:
- Show "covered/not covered" for battery/ADAS by each insurer
- Convert policy language to easy-to-understand UI

### 3. SLA & Escalation System

**Features**:
- Default SLA based on partnership agreements
- Auto-escalate to higher insurer level if overdue
- Internal "case owner" assignment

## Elevator Pitch (Aug 22, 2025)

> Ở Việt Nam, bồi thường xe ô tô – đặc biệt xe điện – vẫn chậm, phức tạp và thiếu minh bạch.
>
> Fermion có hệ thống lớn nhưng chưa tối ưu cho EV.
> FPT.AI có AI mạnh nhưng không có giải pháp end-to-end.
>
> Chúng tôi xây dựng **EV Claims Hub**: một nền tảng kết nối trực tiếp chủ xe, garage và công ty bảo hiểm.
>
> **Flow**: Chủ xe nộp hồ sơ online → AI ước lượng chi phí sửa chữa từ dữ liệu VinFast và garage EV → insurer phê duyệt nhanh → garage nhận thanh toán theo mốc minh bạch.
>
> **Kết quả**: từ vài tuần xuống còn vài ngày, chi phí giảm, trải nghiệm khách hàng vượt trội.
>
> Đây là hạ tầng claims chuyên biệt đầu tiên xoay quanh khách hàng và tập trung cho hệ sinh thái xe điện tại Việt Nam.

## Deeper Competitive Analysis (Aug 24, 2025)

### FPT.AI Reality Check

- [FPT.AI Insurance Use Cases](https://fpt.ai/vi/use-cases/bao-hiem/)
- Developed by FPT Smart Cloud (FPT Group)
- Partners: Bảo Việt, Vietinbank Insurance, Prudential, AIA, FWD, Dai-ichi Life

**Assessment**: Mainly chatbot use cases trained on insurance operations. **Not a breakthrough for claim processing.**

### Merimen Reality Check

- [Merimen Vietnam](https://www.merimen.com/software-as-a-service-vn.html)
- Provides solutions for insurers
- Includes remote platform connecting claims processing ecosystem

**Assessment**: B2B insurer platform, not customer-centric.

## Status (Aug 24, 2025)

**Insights gained, but little progress.**

Still exploring, no strong evidence found yet to support hypotheses.
