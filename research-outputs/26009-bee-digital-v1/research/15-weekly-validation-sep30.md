## Key Learnings

### 1. EV/Car Owners: NOT a Major Pain Point

> "Người dùng xe điện có thể vẫn muốn một trải nghiệm lái xe nào đó thú vị và mới mẻ, tuy nhiên vấn đề Bảo hiểm xe nói chung không phải một pain points lớn."

**Reality**: Vietnamese car owners are relatively well-served compared to foreign markets. Any solution is **vitamins, not painkillers**.

**Strategic shift**:
> **"Focus on making great vitamins, not great painkillers"**

### 2. Insurers: Real Problem, Not Urgent

**Profile - Anh Phong (MIC)**:
- Mid-level manager, directly implements claims work
- Received "digital transformation" mandate from leadership (40% autonomous approval)
- Can order IT solutions from shared IT team (with MBB)
- Receives handover and operates software independently

**Assessment**:
- Pain is **real** ✓
- Pain is **significant** ✓
- Pain is **NOT urgent** ✗ (they're OK with current internal solutions)

**Recommendation**: Look for more urgent problems, or propose vitamins with clear benefits. Focus on **early partnership for light POC**, no rush.

### 3. Garages: High Potential, Low Politics

**Before interview**: Least attention given, solutions were generic.

**After interview**: Identified key insights:
- Garages are **simple, less political**
- Potential to develop solutions around them
- Help simplify "insurance customer" repair process
- Help increase revenue and profit

**Scale opportunity**:
- 151 VinFast workshops
- **Plus**: National network of private garages

**Scope Definition**:

| In-Scope | Out-of-Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Vehicle repair (working with insurers) | Operations, garage management |
| Insurance claim processing | Technical issues |
| | Warranty/maintenance (OEM work) |

## Strategic Pivots

### Pivot 1: Don't Depend on VinFast OEM

**Before**: Need VinFast cooperation to research EV-specific solutions

**After**: Target broader market - car owners with **CarPlay or Android Box**

**Idea**: Gamified safe driving app (CarPlay compatible)
- Monthly prizes (100M VND)
- National leaderboard
- Collect driving behavior data without OEM dependency

### Pivot 2: Start Small, Not Platform

**Before**: Build fancy claims + fraud detection platform with VinFast + 7 major insurers to "transparentize" entire Vietnam insurance industry

**After**: Solve smaller problem first to validate desirability risk

**POC Scope**:
- **5 garages** + **1 strong insurer**
- Light, fast, learnable

> **Translation**: Instead of building a fancy platform... solve a smaller problem first to validate desirability risk.
