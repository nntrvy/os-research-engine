## Key Insights Summary

| Insight | Evidence Strength | Implication |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Digitization pressure is real | Medium | Market is ready |
| Fraud detection NOT a priority | **Strong** | Don't lead with this |
| AI Call Center = urgent need | **Strong** | Best entry point |
| VinFast won't co-develop | Weak | Target insurers first |

---

## 1. Digitization Need (Medium Evidence)

**Finding**: Claims departments under pressure to digitize and apply AI to shorten resolution time.

**Barriers**:
- Lack resources to build in-house
- No suitable Vietnam solution that integrates with existing systems

**Leadership priorities**:
- Clear feasibility
- Easy integration
- Some insurers evaluate adjusters on processing speed → serious about CX improvement

**Specific KPI revealed**:
> "40% of claims volume must be processed fully by AI, without adjuster intervention, without hiring more people when scaling."

---

## 2. Fraud Detection - NOT a Priority (Strong Evidence)

**Finding**: Fraud detection is NOT a major concern for insurer leadership in Vietnam.

**Reasons**:
- Fraud at some level is considered an **"unwritten rule"** (luật ngầm) in the industry
- Very difficult to measure and quantify actual savings

**Implication**: Do NOT position Electrik around fraud detection as primary value prop.

---

## 3. AI Call Center Opportunity (Strong Evidence)

**Finding**: Some insurers have researched AI call centers to improve customer service, but no effective solution exists in the market.

**Critical signal**:
> During the conversation, a partner immediately asked: **"Can you build this solution for me?"** after hearing about AI Call Center.

**Implication**: This shows extreme urgency. AI Call Center could be the **fastest entry point** and quickest win.

**Recommendation**: Dedicate significant time and resources to research & pilot AI Call Center.

---

## 4. VinFast Perspective (Weak Evidence)

**Finding**: If insurers have a proven, reliable solution, VinFast might consider integration.

**However**:
- They will NOT co-develop from scratch when nothing is proven
- Better insurance experience is a **small priority** in VinFast's strategy
- They only care about **GSM as main customer**
- Everything requires **Vingroup chairman approval**

**Implication**: Don't waste time trying to partner with VinFast until insurers are onboard.

---

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy (Derived)

### Primary Target: Insurers (not OEMs)

### Tactics:
1. **Pitch multiple insurers simultaneously** → create competitive pressure
2. **Don't position around fraud detection**
3. **Focus messaging on**:
   - Innovation & modernization
   - Operational efficiency (KPIs, resource savings)
   - Fast, measurable results
   - **Personal wins for leadership** (recognition, bonuses, shareholder credibility)

### Priority Entry Point: AI Call Center
- Concrete, specific use case
- Easy to demonstrate "quick win" for insurer leadership
- Lower technical risk than full claims automation

---

## Conclusion

> **Cơ hội lớn nhất nằm ở việc đồng hành cùng insurers trong hành trình số hoá quy trình bồi thường, đặc biệt với hai mảng trọng điểm: AI cho giám định và AI Call Center.**

**Translation**: The biggest opportunity is partnering with insurers on claims digitization journey, especially two focus areas: **AI inspection** and **AI Call Center**.

These are their real pain points. OEMs like VinFast only care once insurers prove the solution.

---

## Evidence Weighting Note

This interview data should be **weighted heavily** in future decisions:
- Direct conversations with decision-makers
- Revealed actual priorities (vs. assumed priorities)
- Uncovered "unwritten rules" about fraud
- Identified specific KPIs and entry points
