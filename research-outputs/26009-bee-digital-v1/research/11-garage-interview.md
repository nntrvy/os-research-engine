**Date**: Sep 25, 2025

**Interviewee**: Service workshop manager, VinFast GMS Gia Lâm

**Status**: Raw evidence (not yet synthesized)

## 1. Garage Pain Points

| Pain | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Document preparation** | Collecting & preparing insurance documents is time-consuming and labor-intensive |
| **Approval waiting** | Insurance approval takes long; if documents are incomplete, insurers don't notify - **garage must chase** |

---

## 2. Garage Wants ("Vitamins")

- Additional revenue from insurance customers (if profitable)
- Simplified insurance process - easier to understand
- Faster insurance approval - less waiting time

---

## 3. System & Process Observations

### Current Tech Stack

| System | Purpose | Issue |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **DMS** (OEM-provided) | Manage most processes incl. parts ordering | Clunky, hard to use |
| **MISA** (accounting) | Issue invoices | No integration with DMS |

### The Invoice Problem

For insurance claims, **VAT invoice must be issued BEFORE submitting claim**.

**Current workarounds**:
1. Staff manually copy repair services from DMS → MISA
2. Some garages use parallel garage management software alongside DMS

### What Works Fine

- Other steps (besides documents & invoicing) are not major issues
- Payment after 15-20 days is fine - contracts already signed with each insurer

---

## 4. Photo Documentation Process

**Critical finding**: Insurers do NOT accept photos taken by garage.

| Current Process | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| Adjuster must visit | In-person to take photos |
| Proprietary apps | Each insurer has own inspection/photo software |
| Visit frequency | ~1x per day, handle multiple cases per visit |

**Opportunity**: If photos could be accepted from garage with proper verification → significant time savings.

## 5. Revenue Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average monthly revenue | **3.6B VND/month** |
| Insurance customers | ~15% of revenue |
| Insurance revenue | **~600M VND/month** |

### Margin Analysis

| Work Type | Margin |
|-----------|--------|
| Warranty work | Low profit |
| Insurance work | **Higher profit** (includes labor component) |

---

## 6. Expert Perspective on Market Dynamics

### Three Parties Analysis

| Party | Pain Level | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Car buyers** | Low | Generally well-served, even by global standards |
| **Insurers** | Low motivation | Won't change unless clear benefit |
| **Garages** | **High pain, high power** | Most important in the chain |

**Key insight**:
> "Garage là bên quan trọng và có nhiều quyền lực nhất trong chuỗi. Đây là nhóm cần đào sâu nghiên cứu thêm."

**Translation**: Garages are the most important and powerful party in the chain. This is the group that needs deeper research.
