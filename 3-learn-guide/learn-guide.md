## The Two-Step Learning Process

After running experiments, you need to extract meaningful learnings from the evidence collected.

### Step 1: Analyze the Evidence

Evidence does not speak on its own. Gather the evidence you have from different experiments for a specific hypothesis and analyze it.

**Key Actions:**
- Collect all data from experiments
- Distinguish between strong and weak evidence
- Look for patterns across multiple data sources
- Challenge your interpretations

### Step 2: Gain Insights

Insights are key learnings you get from analyzing the data. They allow you to support or refute the hypotheses you've been testing.

**Your insights help you understand how likely your idea is to work.**

---

## What is Evidence?

**Evidence is what you use to support or refute the hypotheses underlying your business idea.**

Evidence is data that you get from research or generate from business experiments. It can come in many different forms, ranging from weak to strong evidence.

### Business Experiment Evidence

For the purposes of testing business ideas, we focus on business experiment evidence, which is defined as:

- Data generated from an experiment or collected in the field
- Facts that support or refute a hypothesis
- Can be of different natures (quotes, behaviors, conversion rates, orders, purchases)
- Can be weak or strong

---

## Strength of Evidence

The strength of a piece of evidence determines how reliably it helps support or refute a hypothesis. You can evaluate the strength of evidence by checking four areas:

### Evidence Strength Spectrum

| Dimension | Weak Evidence ←――――――→ Strong Evidence |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **1. Beliefs vs. Facts** | Opinions: "I would...", "I think...", "I believe...", "I like..." | Facts: "Last week I...", "In that situation I usually...", "I spent... on" |
| **2. Say vs. Do** | What people say in an interview or survey is not necessarily what they do in real life or will do in the future | Observable behavior is generally a good predictor of how people act and what people might do in the future |
| **3. Lab vs. Real World** | When people are aware that you are testing something, they may behave differently than in a real world setting | The most reliable predictor of future behavior is what you observe people doing when they are not aware they are being tested |
| **4. Small vs. Large Investment** | Signing up by email to be informed about an upcoming product release is a small investment and relatively weak evidence of interest | Pre-purchasing a product or putting one's professional reputation on the line is an important investment and strong evidence of real interest |

---

## What are Insights?

**There is a difference between looking at something and looking for something.**

Evidence on its own will not help you reduce risk in your business idea; therefore, we recommend gleaning insights from the evidence your experiments generate.

### Business Insights Definition

For the purposes of testing business ideas, business insights are defined as:

- What you learn from studying the evidence
- Learning related to the validity of a hypothesis and potential discovery of new directions
- The foundation to make informed business decisions and take action

## The Learning Card

The Learning Card captures insights from experiments and translates them into decisions and actions.

### The Four Components

| Component | Description | Prompt |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Hypothesis** | The hypothesis you were testing (past tense) | "We believed that..." |
| **2. Observation** | What the evidence actually showed | "We observed..." |
| **3. Learnings & Insights** | What you learned from the evidence | "From that we learned that..." |
| **4. Decisions & Actions** | What you will do next based on the learning | "Therefore, we will..." |

### Learning Card Metadata

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Insight Name** | Descriptive name for the learning |
| **Person Responsible** | Person who analyzed the evidence |
| **Date of Learning** | When the insight was captured |
| **Data Reliability** | How reliable is the evidence (1-3 scale) |
| **Action Required** | Level of action needed based on insight |

---

## Confidence Level

**Your confidence level indicates how much you believe that your evidence is strong enough to support or refute a specific hypothesis.**

Not all evidence and insights are equal. You should be more confident about your insights when you've run several experiments with increasingly strong evidence for a specific hypothesis.

### Three Dimensions of Confidence

| Dimension | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Type and Strength of Evidence** | Different types of evidence have different strengths. A quote from an interview is relatively weak. A purchase in a simulated sale is very strong. | The type of evidence collected influences how confident you can be about the reliability of your insights |
| **2. Number of Data Points** | The more data points you have, the better. Five quotes from personal customer interviews is weaker than 100 quotes. However, those same quotes are likely to be more accurate than 100 data points in an anonymous survey. | More data generally increases confidence, but quality matters |
| **3. Number and Type of Experiments** | Your confidence level should rise with the number of experiments you conduct to test the same hypothesis. Three interview series are better than one. | Conducting interviews, surveys, AND simulated sales for the same hypothesis is best |

### Confidence Level Scale

| Level | Description | When You Reach It |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Very Confident** | Strong basis for decision-making | You've run several experiments of which at least one is a call-to-action test that produced very strong evidence |
| **Somewhat Confident** | Good progress but could use more validation | You've run several experiments that produce strong evidence or a particularly strong call-to-action experiment |
| **Not Really Confident** | Need more and stronger experiments | You've only done interviews or surveys in which people say what they will do. They might behave differently in reality |
| **Not Confident at All** | Too early to make decisions | You've only run one experiment that produces weak evidence, such as an interview or survey |

---

## Different Experiments Create Different Evidence

Running multiple experiment types for the same hypothesis creates varied evidence strength.

### Example: Testing "Millennial parents prefer curated science projects"

| Experiment | Evidence Type | Evidence Strength | Sample Data |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Customer Interviews** | Transcripts & Quotes | ●○○○○ (Weak) | "We want our child to have a unique science fair project that stands out" / "It has to be appropriate for her grade level" / "I'd pay to have a science project kit with everything we need all in a box" |
| **Search Trend Analysis** | Search Volume Data | ●●●○○ (Medium) | "science fair ideas" had 5k-10k searches / "kindergarten science fair ideas" had 10k-15k searches / "first grade science fair ideas" had 1k-5k searches |
| **Concierge** | Operational Data | ●●●●● (Strong) | Time to Create = 2 hours per kit / Cost to Create = $10-$15 / Cost to Ship = $5-$8 / Parent Satisfaction Score = Partially Satisfied |

### How to Build Confidence

1. **Start with discovery** — Interviews to understand jobs, pains, gains
2. **Validate at scale** — Surveys to test insights with more people
3. **Test behavior** — Call-to-action experiments (landing pages, pre-sales)
4. **Confirm with action** — Simulated or real sales

---

## Learning Card Examples

### Example 1: Customer Interviews

**Hypothesis:** We believed that millennial parents prefer curated science projects that fit their kids' education level.

**Observation:** We observed millennial parents want their kids to have a unique project with clear instructions that matches their ability.

**Learning:** From that we learned that uniqueness was a top job that we had previously not emphasized.

**Action:** Therefore, we will use the unique customer language in our upcoming landing page's value proposition.

---

### Example 2: Search Trend Analysis

**Hypothesis:** We believed that millennial parents prefer curated science projects that fit their kids' education level.

**Observation:** We observed millennial parents are searching online for science fair ideas.

**Learning:** From that we learned that kindergarten grade level yielded the most search volume.

**Action:** Therefore, we will dive deeper into the parents of kindergarteners to better understand their needs.

---

### Example 3: Concierge

**Hypothesis:** We believed that millennial parents prefer curated science projects that fit their kids' education level.

**Observation:** We observed overall feedback was positive, but time and cost for creating the kits exceeded our target price point.

**Learning:** From that we learned that even though parents are satisfied, we have to find ways to bring the time and cost down.

**Action:** Therefore, we will explore wholesale suppliers and find optimized steps to assemble the kits.

## Writing Good Learning Cards

### Step 1: Hypothesis (Past Tense)

**Format:** "We believed that [the hypothesis you tested]"

Note: Use past tense because you're reflecting on what you tested.

### Step 2: Observation

**Format:** "We observed [what the data actually showed]"

✅ Good: "We observed millennial parents want unique projects with clear instructions"
❌ Bad: "We observed people liked our idea"

### Step 3: Learnings & Insights

**Format:** "From that we learned that [specific insight]"

✅ Good: "From that we learned that uniqueness was a top job we had not emphasized"
❌ Bad: "From that we learned that we should continue"

### Step 4: Decisions & Actions

**Format:** "Therefore, we will [specific next action]"

✅ Good: "Therefore, we will use unique customer language in our landing page"
❌ Bad: "Therefore, we will keep going"

## From Test Card to Learning Card

The Test Card and Learning Card work as a pair:

```
TEST CARD (Before)                    LEARNING CARD (After)
─────────────────────                 ─────────────────────
We believe that...           →        We believed that...
To verify that, we will...   →        We observed...
And measure...               →        From that we learned that...
We are right if...           →        Therefore, we will...
```

**Key Shift:** The Learning Card reflects on what was tested and captures the insights and next steps.

---

## Quick Reference

### Evidence Strength Checklist

Ask these questions to evaluate evidence strength:

- [ ] Is it based on facts or opinions?
- [ ] Is it what people say or what they do?
- [ ] Was it collected in lab or real-world settings?
- [ ] Did it require small or large investment from participants?

### Learning Card Template

```
HYPOTHESIS: We believed that [hypothesis you tested]

OBSERVATION: We observed [what the data showed]

LEARNING: From that we learned that [specific insight]

ACTION: Therefore, we will [specific next step]
```

### Confidence Building Sequence

1. Interviews (weak evidence) → Initial insights
2. Surveys (weak-medium evidence) → Validate at scale
3. Landing pages (medium evidence) → Test interest
4. Pre-sales/Concierge (strong evidence) → Test real behavior
5. Pilot/Sales (very strong evidence) → Confirm demand
