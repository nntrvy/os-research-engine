# The OS Research Manifesto

---

## We're Not Building Startups. We're Creating Blue Oceans.

Most startup studios are factories. Churn out apps. Chase trends. Copy what's working in the US. Pray something sticks.

**We're not a factory. We're explorers.**

We believe there are 50 blue oceans waiting to be discovered. New market spaces where competition doesn't exist because you created the game. Where you don't fight for market share—you create new demand.

Cirque du Soleil didn't compete with Ringling Brothers. They made the circus irrelevant.

Nintendo Wii didn't fight Sony and Microsoft. They made hardcore gaming irrelevant.

Yellow Tail didn't compete with French wineries. They made wine snobbery irrelevant.

**We're going to do this 50 times.**

---

## The Belief System

We believe:

**1. Red oceans are a choice, not a fate.**
Every "crowded market" has a blue ocean hiding inside it. Most people just can't see it because they're too busy copying competitors.

**2. The best ideas look stupid at first.**
If everyone gets it immediately, you're probably in a red ocean. Blue oceans feel weird until they're obvious.

**3. Validation > Vision.**
Big visions are cheap. We don't trust ideas—we test them. Structured experiments. Real evidence. Kill what doesn't work. Double down on what does.

**4. Transparency is a superpower.**
We share everything. The wins. The losses. The numbers. The failures. The pivots. Because the journey is the product.

**5. AI is our unfair advantage.**
We use AI to research faster, validate cheaper, and think bigger than studios 10x our size.

## The 1,000 True Believers

We don't want followers. We want **believers**.

People who:

- 🔥 **Subscribe** to our newsletter and actually read it
- 📺 **Watch hours** of our behind-the-scenes on YouTube
- 🗣️ **Tell everyone** about this crazy studio hunting blue oceans
- 💼 **Dream of working** with us (and DM us constantly)
- 🧠 **Can't shut up** about blue ocean strategy at dinner parties
- 🌊 **See blue oceans** everywhere now because we ruined them

**1,000 people like this is worth more than 100,000 casual followers.**

These aren't subscribers. They're the founding members of a movement.

## The Voice

**We are not:**
- Corporate
- Dry
- "Thought leaders"
- Buzzword machines
- Humble-braggers
- Polished to the point of boring

**We are:**
- Obsessed (about blue oceans, obviously)
- Honest (even when it hurts)
- Curious (about everything)
- A little bit crazy (in the good way)
- Visual (show, don't tell)
- Human (we fuck up and we share it)

**The vibe:**
- Anthony Bourdain exploring street food, but for business ideas
- A documentary crew following treasure hunters
- Scientists who get excited about their experiments
- Founders building in public with nothing to hide

## The Visual Language

We tell stories with visuals, not walls of text.

**What our content looks like:**

```
NOT THIS:                           THIS:
─────────                           ─────────

"Our market research               [Photo of whiteboard covered
indicates significant              in Post-its, someone pointing
opportunity in the DOOH            at a Strategy Canvas]
advertising space with
projected CAGR of 10.14%           "Day 47. We finally see it.
and potential TAM of               The taxi screen market has
$282M by 2033."                    a massive blue ocean hiding
                                   in plain sight. Here's what
(Kill me)                          everyone's missing..."

                                   [Thread continues with visuals]
```

**Visual elements:**
- Strategy Canvases (hand-drawn, messy, real)
- Before/After comparisons
- Whiteboard sessions
- Real screenshots of our tools
- Faces of the team (not stock photos)
- Numbers in big, bold graphics
- The journey (not just the destination)

## The Documentary Approach

We're filming our own startup studio documentary. In real-time. For years.

**Episode types:**

🎬 **"The Hunt"**
Following a blue ocean from first hunch to validation (or death). The research. The dead ends. The breakthrough moment.

🎬 **"Blue Ocean Breakdown"**
Deep dive into one company that created a blue ocean. Not surface-level. The full story. The Strategy Canvas. The lessons.

🎬 **"Inside the Studio"**
Day in the life. How we work. How we use AI. The tools. The rituals. The chaos.

🎬 **"The Graveyard"**
Ideas we killed and why. Most studios hide their failures. We make episodes about them.

---

## What Believers Experience

**Week 1:** "Interesting newsletter, I'll check it out"

**Month 1:** "Okay these blue ocean breakdowns are actually good"

**Month 3:** "I'm using the Strategy Canvas at work now"

**Month 6:** "Did you know Yellow Tail created a blue ocean by making wine for beer drinkers? Let me tell you about it..."

**Year 1:** "I've watched every episode. I applied to work there. I've told everyone I know. I see blue oceans everywhere now and it's your fault."

## The Cult Markers

You know you've built a cult when:

- [ ] People use your language ("that's a red ocean", "where's the blue ocean?")
- [ ] They screenshot your content and share it
- [ ] They tag friends saying "this is the studio I told you about"
- [ ] They reply to every newsletter
- [ ] They watch 45-minute videos about Strategy Canvases
- [ ] They pitch you their blue ocean ideas unsolicited
- [ ] They defend you in comment sections
- [ ] They apply to work with you repeatedly
- [ ] They recognize you at events and want to talk for an hour
- [ ] They start their own blue ocean projects because of you

## The North Star

**By end of 2026:**

1,000 people who would be genuinely sad if OS Research disappeared.

Not followers. Not subscribers. Not impressions.

**Believers.**

---

## The Tagline Options

*Pick the one that feels right:*

> "Hunting blue oceans."

> "50 blue oceans or bust."

> "Creating markets, not competing in them."

> "The studio that shares everything."

> "We find blue oceans. Then we show you how."

---

## The Promise

To our 1,000 believers, we promise:

1. **We'll share everything.** Every experiment. Every failure. Every number.

2. **We'll never be boring.** If it's dry, we'll make it visual. If it's complex, we'll make it clear.

3. **We'll stay obsessed.** Blue oceans aren't a content strategy. They're our life's work.

4. **We'll help you see them too.** By the time we're done, you'll spot blue oceans in every industry you look at.

5. **We'll build the 50.** And you'll watch it happen in real-time.

*This isn't content marketing. This is a documentary of a mission.*

*Come watch us hunt.*
