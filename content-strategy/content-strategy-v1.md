# OS Research Content Strategy

**The 10-Year Journal**

---

## The Vision

We're not building a content brand. We're documenting a decade-long mission to become Vietnam's #1 venture studio.

No thought leadership. No advice threads. No "5 tips for founders."

Just the raw, unfiltered story of building startups that matter.

---

## Who We Are

**An independent startup studio that gets our hands dirty.**

We don't sit in offices making slide decks. We're in the streets, in the markets, in the factories. Talking to Grab drivers about their insurance fears. Sitting with street vendors at 5am to understand their day. Watching how families make financial decisions.

We build empathy first. Then we build products.

And we document everything.

---

## The Content Philosophy

### 1. Show, Don't Tell

We don't write about "how to do customer interviews."
We film ourselves doing them. The awkward silences. The breakthrough moments. The times we got it completely wrong.

### 2. The Journey, Not The Destination

We're not pretending to have answers.
We're documenting the search for them.

10 years. 50 blue oceans. Hundreds of failures. A few massive wins.
Every step captured.

### 3. Cinematic, Not Corporate

Our content looks like a documentary, not a pitch deck.
Think A24 meets Y Combinator.
Beautiful. Raw. Real.

### 4. Quiet Confidence

We don't need to be loud.
The work speaks.
The products speak.
The founders we back speak.

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Field Notes (40%)
*Behind the scenes of problem discovery*

What it looks like:
- Video diary of visiting a wet market at 4am to understand vendor pain points
- Photo essay of a week shadowing Grab drivers
- Audio recording of a mother explaining why she doesn't trust insurance
- Sketches and notes from user observation sessions

Format: Raw, documentary-style. Handheld camera. Natural light. Real conversations.

---

### Pillar 2: The Build Log (30%)
*Prototypes, failures, iterations*

What it looks like:
- Timelapse of building an MVP in 72 hours
- Screenshot walkthrough of a prototype with honest critique
- Video of user testing session (the good and the cringe)
- Post-mortem of a product we killed and why

Format: Screen recordings, workshop footage, whiteboard sessions, code commits with context.

---

### Pillar 3: The Founder Files (20%)
*Stories of the people we back*

What it looks like:
- 5-minute mini-documentary on a founder's journey
- Day-in-the-life video of a portfolio company
- Interview in their actual workspace (not a studio)
- The moment they decided to quit their job and build

Format: Cinematic portraits. Intimate. No corporate b-roll.

---

### Pillar 4: The Playbook (10%)
*Open-sourcing our methodology*

What it looks like:
- Visual guides to our validation process
- Templates we actually use (Figma, Notion, sheets)
- The frameworks that work (and the ones we abandoned)
- Quarterly reflection on what we learned

Format: Clean, minimal design. Functional, not flashy. Free to download.

---

## The Channels

### Primary: YouTube (Long-form Documentary)

This is where the real story lives.

| Series | Format | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Field Notes** | 10-20 min documentary episodes | 2x/month |
| **Build in Public** | 5-10 min build logs | Weekly |
| **Founder Files** | 15-30 min portraits | Monthly |
| **The Playbook** | Tutorial/guide videos | Monthly |

Why YouTube:
- Long-form allows real storytelling
- Searchable, evergreen content
- Builds deep connection over time
- Vietnam's YouTube penetration is massive

---

### Secondary: Instagram (Visual Diary)

The daily journal. Quick glimpses into the work.

| Format | Content | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stories** | Behind-the-scenes, daily work | Daily |
| **Reels** | 30-60 sec moments from the field | 3x/week |
| **Carousel** | Photo essays, visual frameworks | 2x/week |
| **Posts** | Key moments, milestones | 1x/week |

Aesthetic: Film photography feel. Warm tones. Human-centered. No stock photos ever.

---

### Tertiary: Newsletter (The Weekly Dispatch)

One email. Every Friday. What happened this week.

Structure:
1. **This week in the field** - Where we went, who we talked to
2. **What we're building** - Prototype updates, learnings
3. **One honest reflection** - What's hard right now
4. **Photo of the week** - One image that captures the week

No fluff. No links to "must-read articles." Just us.

---

### LinkedIn: Minimal Presence

We post when we have something real to share:
- Major milestones
- Founder announcements
- Playbook releases
- Big learnings

Not for engagement farming. For credibility when people search us.

Build the raw material library.

Don't publish until it feels right.

---

## What Success Looks Like

### Not Vanity Metrics

We don't care about:
- Follower counts
- Viral moments
- Engagement rates

### Real Impact

We care about:
- **Founders who found us and said "this is what I needed"**
- **Other studios asking to learn our methodology**
- **Government citing our playbook in innovation policy**
- **Products we built that users genuinely love**
- **A body of work we're proud of in 10 years**

### The Ultimate Measure

In 2036, someone studying Vietnam's startup ecosystem watches our content and understands exactly how it was built.

That's the archive we're creating.

---

## Content Guidelines

### What We Do

- Show real work, real people, real moments
- Embrace imperfection and failure
- Tell human stories, not business stories
- Create beautiful, cinematic content
- Open-source our learnings
- Take our time to get it right

### What We Don't Do

- Engagement bait or growth hacks
- Advice threads or hot takes
- Corporate polish or stock imagery
- Post for the sake of posting
- Chase trends or algorithms
- Pretend we have all the answers

## The Vibe

**References:**

- *Jiro Dreams of Sushi* - Obsessive craft, quiet mastery
- *Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown* - Real places, real people
- *Abstract: The Art of Design* - Beautiful process documentation
- *Patagonia's brand films* - Values-driven, authentic
- *Humans of New York* - Intimate human stories

**Music:** Ambient, minimal, emotional. Think Ólafur Arnalds, Nils Frahm.

**Color:** Warm, filmic. Not oversaturated. Real.

**Pacing:** Slow when it needs to be. Let moments breathe.

---

## Closing Thought

We're not building a content strategy.

We're building an archive of a mission.

Every video, photo, and word is a piece of evidence that we showed up, did the work, and tried to build something that matters.

In 10 years, this content will be the proof.

---

*"We will be unforgiving in solving problems and creating the most awesome products ever."*
