# OS Research Content Strategy

**The 10-Year Journal**

---

## The Vision

We're not building a content brand. We're documenting a decade-long mission to become Vietnam's #1 venture studio.

No thought leadership. No advice threads. No "5 tips for founders."

Just the raw, unfiltered story of building startups that matter—and giving back everything we learn along the way.

---

## Who We Are

**An independent startup studio that gets our hands dirty.**

We don't sit in offices making slide decks. We're in the streets, in the markets, in the factories. Talking to Grab drivers about their insurance fears. Sitting with street vendors at 5am to understand their day. Watching how families make financial decisions.

We build empathy first. Then we build products.

And we document everything—in words, images, and video.

---

## The Content Philosophy

### 1. Learn in Public, Give Back Everything

We study the world's best blue oceans. We test frameworks. We run experiments.
Then we share it all. The tools, the templates, the failures.

The Vietnamese startup ecosystem rises together.

### 2. Words and Images

Great stories need both.
Long-form essays for depth. Video for emotion. Diagrams for clarity.
Each format serves its purpose.

### 3. The Journey, Not The Destination

We're not pretending to have answers.
We're documenting the search for them.

10 years. 50 blue oceans. Hundreds of failures. A few massive wins.
Every step captured.

### 4. Quiet Confidence

We don't need to be loud.
The work speaks.
The products speak.
The founders we back speak.

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Field Notes (25%)

## What Success Looks Like

### Not Vanity Metrics

We don't care about:
- Follower counts
- Viral moments
- Engagement rates

### Real Impact

We care about:
- **Founders who use our playbook to validate their ideas**
- **Startups applying Blue Ocean thinking because of our essays**
- **Other studios adopting our open-source methodology**
- **Government referencing our frameworks in innovation policy**
- **A body of work we're proud of in 10 years**

### The Ultimate Measure

In 2036, a first-time founder in Da Nang uses our Playbook to validate their idea, reads our Blue Ocean essays to find their market, and builds something that matters.

That's why we give it all away.

## Closing Thought

We're not building a content strategy.

We're building an open-source playbook for Vietnam's startup ecosystem.

Every essay, template, and framework is a gift to founders who are just starting out. Every Blue Ocean analysis is a lesson we learned the hard way.

In 10 years, this content will be the proof that we showed up, did the work, and gave back everything we learned.

*"We will be unforgiving in solving problems and creating the most awesome products ever."*
