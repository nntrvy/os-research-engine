# OS Research Content Strategy

**For Content Team | Budget: 50M VND/month**

---

## Mission

Document our 10-year journey to become Vietnam's #1 venture studio. Give back everything we learn to the ecosystem.

---

## Who We Are

Independent startup studio. We validate ideas, build prototypes, invest in what works.

We get our hands dirty—talking to Grab drivers, sitting with street vendors at 5am, watching how families make financial decisions.

We build empathy first. Then products.

---

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Field Notes (25%)
*Stories from problem discovery*

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Essay (1,500-3,000 words) | "What I learned spending a week with Grab drivers" |
| Video (10-15 min) | Documentary of visiting wet market at 4am |
| Written interview | A mother's take on why she doesn't trust insurance |

---

### Pillar 2: Build Log (20%)
*Prototypes, failures, iterations*

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Case study | "We killed this product after 6 weeks. Here's why." |
| Post-mortem | What went wrong, what we'd do differently |
| Video (5-10 min) | Timelapse of building MVP in 72 hours |

### Pillar 4: The Playbook (25%)

Everything free. No gatekeeping.
