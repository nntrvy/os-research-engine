## The Goal

**1,000 loyal fans by end of 2026.**

Not followers. Not subscribers. Not impressions.

Loyal fans who:
- Subscribe to our newsletter and actually read it
- Watch hours of our behind-the-scenes content
- Tell their friends and family about us
- Want to apply and work with us
- Won't shut up about OS Research at dinner parties

1,000 people like this is worth more than 100,000 casual followers.

## Why This Matters

We're on a mission to create 50 blue oceans. That's ambitious. That's weird. That takes years.

We need people who believe in the mission. People who follow the journey. People who cheer us on when we succeed and stick around when we fail.

These 1,000 fans become our:
- First customers for new ventures
- Source of referrals and introductions
- Recruiting pipeline for talent
- Accountability partners (they'll notice if we go quiet)

## Who We're Looking For

Our ideal fan is someone who:

**Gets excited about blue oceans** — They've heard of Cirque du Soleil, Yellow Tail, Nintendo Wii. Or they haven't, but once we explain it, their eyes light up.

**Loves watching things get built** — Behind-the-scenes content. Real numbers. The mess, not just the wins.

**Is curious about Vietnam/Asia** — They want to see what's possible in emerging markets.

**Might be a founder themselves** — Or wants to be. Or works at a startup. Or just thinks like one.

## Our Voice

We're not corporate. We're not "thought leaders." We're not polished to the point of boring.

**We are:**
- Obsessed (about blue oceans, obviously)
- Honest (even when it hurts)
- Visual (show, don't tell)
- Human (we fuck up and we share it)

**The vibe:** Anthony Bourdain meets startup documentary. Explorers hunting for something most people can't see.

## What We'll Create

**Newsletter: "Blue Ocean Weekly"**
- Every Friday
- 5-minute read
- One blue ocean case study + what we're building + what we learned

**YouTube: Documentary-style**
- Behind-the-scenes of hunting blue oceans
- Deep dives into famous blue ocean cases
- Our failures and pivots (most studios hide these, we make episodes about them)

**LinkedIn/Social**
- Visual storytelling
- Strategy Canvases, not walls of text
- Real photos, not stock images

## How We'll Know It's Working

**Cult markers:**
- [ ] People use our language ("that's a red ocean")
- [ ] They screenshot and share our content
- [ ] They reply to every newsletter
- [ ] They watch 45-minute videos about Strategy Canvases
- [ ] They pitch us blue ocean ideas unsolicited
- [ ] They apply to work with us repeatedly
- [ ] They'd be genuinely sad if we disappeared

## The Promise

To our 1,000 fans, we promise:

1. **We'll share everything.** Every experiment. Every failure. Every number.
2. **We'll never be boring.** Visual, not dry. Story, not report.
3. **We'll stay obsessed.** This isn't a content strategy. It's our life's work.
4. **We'll build the 50.** And they'll watch it happen in real-time.

## Open Questions

1. Who owns this? Content lead? Founder-led for now?
2. Newsletter platform: Substack or Beehiiv?
3. What's our first blue ocean case study to publish?
4. Do we have footage to start the YouTube documentary?

---

**Bottom line:** We're building a cult around the 50 blue oceans mission. 1,000 true believers who follow the journey, learn the frameworks, and can't stop talking about us.

Let's go hunt. 🌊
