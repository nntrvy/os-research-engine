This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## About This Repository

OS Research Engine is a knowledge base and playbook system for OS Research, an independent startup studio focused on building validated startups in Vietnam. This repository contains strategic frameworks and guides—not application code.

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-first repository containing startup methodology playbooks:

- `key-research-areas.md` — The 5 core problem domains: Education, Insurance, Urban, Health, Culture
- `01-blue-ocean-playbook.md` — Blue Ocean Strategy framework (Value Innovation, 4-Actions Framework)
- `02-value-proposition-design.md` — Value Proposition Canvas guide (Customer Profile, Value Map)
- `03-business-model-design.md` — Business Model Canvas guide (9 building blocks)
- `04-business-pitch.md` — Complete playbook for creating business pitch reports (Market Research + VPC + BMC + 10 Hypotheses)

## Working with These Documents

### Document Conventions

- Documents are numbered (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) to indicate reading/learning order
- Each playbook is self-contained but references others (VPC → BMC → Business Pitch)
- Examples use a "Home Renovation Platform" as a consistent case study across documents

### When Updating Playbooks

- Keep sticky note examples short (3-7 words) — this is intentional
- Maintain the visual ASCII diagrams for canvas representations
- Preserve the ✅ Good / ❌ Bad example format for clarity
- These are living documents meant to be updated as the team learns

## OS Research Context

**Vision:** Build a system to invest early in validated ideas through small bets

**Mission:** Empower Vietnam's startup community with knowledge, case studies, and real examples

**Ambition:** Create 50 blue oceans — bold ideas that reshape markets or create new ones
